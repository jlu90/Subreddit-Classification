You would notice that there are days when you are progressively funny and when you stop for a few days, it takes time to pick it back up. 

Post comments on Reddit and measure the success of your joke/witty comment by the upvotes. Best survey for you and that's what comedians do before putting it in their 'special'. 

Anyway, so also a good answer to the people who think that Reddit is all waste of time. We can use it for our betterment too.

2) Step 1: Get AIDS

3) Step 2: Pay your medical bill except for 1 DOLLAR!

32, Throw out your expectations and just work.," When i started painting it took me 2  years before i showed anyone my work. And when I did, I introduced it as  'shit'. Despite praises from close friends i just couldn't believe that  my paintings were any good because I couldn't put what was in my head  on canvas. The outcome never met my expectations of what i thought was  'good'. Only when i realized a few years down the road that being able to put exactly what was in my head onto canvas IS 'mastery'. That's what the end goal is and it takes work. A LOT of work to get there. 

I  had to throw my expectations out the window and just work. Then after i  was done with a piece i had to objectively see it for what it was with fresh eyes, not what i expected it to be. If I dont like it, I fix it until i do. Most artist hold themselves to the highest of expectations and will be the toughest critic on themselves.

This is why most stop painting. I had to adopt the thinking of 'accept the positive and ignore  the negative.' It makes things so much easier and constant self  critiques only kills the want to paint/ create. Its almost a mindset of  ""Those that mind, don't matter and those that matter, dont mind."" Art is  very subjective to each and every viewer but the 'rules' of what makes a  pleasant, calming or disturbing and off putting image are good to know.

49, Care more about the living than you reminisce the dead.,"Long post alert. My grandfathers on either side died within a year, 10 years ago, and my grandmothers are living alone for most of the time. Many times when their children (my parents, aunts and uncles) gather around, I feel that they reminisce more about their father/father-in-law than actually asking how their mother/mother-in-law is doing. I am not saying that they must ignore their father/FIL once he's dead, but they should check on their mother more than they talk about the father. My parents and uncles/aunts love thier mother but they don't remember to call her due to thier ""busy"" lives. An year ago, when I asked how my grandma was doing and if she needed help in anything, her eyes went misty. Hardly anyone bothered about her needs and wellbeing. I helped setting up her phone and tablet. Now she knows how to video call and sometimes calls me too. I regularly check on her and bring her things that would make her little busy. I showed some gardening channels on YouTube and she started a herb garden all on her own.

Also on another side note, single grand parents are vulnerable to most of the door-to-door marketing executives. My grandma had subscriptions to many online magazines and she hardly knew how to use her email/smartphone.  They might've signed up for many things they may not even need/know. So whenever you visit them, check their accounts and if you see random subscriptions, ask them if they really want them. If they don't, you can cancel them easily as you can call out on marketing BS.

106," If the price an insurance adjuster gives you seems low when your car gets totaled, ask them how many cars they are comparing to and to try expanding the search radius.","**TL;DR** Many car insurance adjusters' systems use a geographical search radius for specific types of cars. If you have a lesser popular/known car, you might benefit by expanding the search radius to include more comparisons. 

Late last year, I was involved in an accident, caused by someone, else that ended up totaling my car--a decade old Hyundai. They were at fault and luckily they had insurance that agreed to pay for damaged.

I chatted with the adjuster for a little and stood nearby while he did his thing. He then informed me the car would be considered totaled and then provided me the amount they would pay.

Having done my research on the value of the car, their number seemed WAY off--like $1500 off.

I asked out him how many cars his system was comparing to. He said six. That's terribly low. I then asked him if he could expand the search radius further because comparing to 6 cars only doesn't make sense.

He did and the number of cars when up considerably, as did the value--about $1300 more.

I agreed on this amount and they hauled the car away shortly after.

People saying how if you don’t agree with them you are a problem etc. which sure there’s some merit to educating people, but at some point you actually have to take action. Putting stories up to the same echo chamber for months does not really do as much as you think even if you believe you are so woke and helping. What you can do is volunteer at a boys and girls club, food banks, homeless shelters. 1 day at any one of those places has such a larger impact on individual and groups than you posting to your 500 followers on Instagram about how they are bad people and need to change to be as good as you are. Put in the work earn, become a real activist, make a real impact, stop blaming everyone else for issues. You’ll feel like a better person and help so many more people.

182, Using a nickname in public/online is a great way to protect yourself from people using public records to find your phone number / house,"It’s basically impossible not to be on public record somewhere, (In the USA at least) when you buy a house, get a phone number, you write your name and address down constantly. So anyone knowing your name / general location can basically find you. Basically all you need is state and first name. If you have an uncommon name it’s even easier. However if you use a nickname, and never even mention your birth name, to your friends online or in public, they really have no way to reverse search it because they don’t know it. The only thing is if you use a common nick name like Kenny - Ken or William - Will, then it’s pretty easy to figure out.",LifeProTips,joeydoesthing,2,1,2020-07-17

More examples: If you want to find out what 2% of 20 is, do 20% of 2 instead and you'll get 0.4. So, 2% of 20 also equals 0.4.

Or, 12% of 25 can be alternatively written out as 25% of 12 instead, which would be 3.

I recently had an interaction with someone looking to build a team. Things were smooth till they decided that they had no need to look at my portfolio (strange indeed since this was for game art)
I was curious to know theirs. The minute you get defensive about your experience or evade questions I will get suspicious however that isn't an issue. A lot of good folks may not have as much experience in real projects but that's okay.

Please lay out your expectations clearly and wait for the person reaching out to confirm their want and desire to work with you especially when they have little to go by. After all you need their help as much as they need the dough.

Do not outright declare that they will be be 'your' new [insert position] especially if they've expressed that it isn't their strong suit.

Also, it ends up feeling like you’ve reduced that entire person to their career. They most likely have other interests which would be more appreciated.

Two examples of gifts I or someone I know has received that have to do with their career and turned out to be very misguided gift-giving: a pair of expensive pruners for a vegetable farmer (they were a weird size, like something you would use to trim a rose bush maybe, not a tomato plant) and a book about astrophysics for an astrophysicist (there’s no way a book you got from Barnes &amp; Noble has any new or interesting information for a PhD candidate).

Wave a metal spoon in the water for 5-10 seconds to hear it. Test the heat of the spoon by gently resting the back of it against a bug bite. Once it is cool enough to tolerate, press the spoon into the bite and let it cool. This uses the heat to denature the enzymes that cause the itching.

230," When deciding to change habits, e.g., cleaning, workout routine, or diet, don't tell anyone, just do it.","If you want to run more, don't tell anyone. Figure out a simple sustainable workout routine and stick to it.

If you want to eat less, don't tell anyone. Figure out a simple sustainable diet and stick to it.

The science speaks for itself. Telling people too early can give you a premature sense of success [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19389130/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19389130/). Small changes are also far more sustainable. I don't necessarily agree with the details of these talks, but the big-picture message about sustainability is consistent: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8),  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=167&amp;v=UNP03fDSj1U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=167&amp;v=UNP03fDSj1U) 

There are other benefits too. For example:

\-If you want to help your spouse around the house more, don't tell them you want to help, just do it.

\-If you want to be kinder to your friends, don't tell anyone, just do it.

If you don't tell anyone your intentions then there's no expectation that you will follow through. Changing habits are hard, and it's not a fast process either. But if you are successful at sustaining some change, it's extremely satisfying when someone takes notice. It's a genuine indicator of improvement as opposed to someone trying to blow smoke up your ass.

As a final note, I leave you with my favorite quote of all time:

&gt;Every day it gets a little easier… But you gotta do it every day — that’s the hard part. But it does get easier

298," If you are driving down the street, and you see someone you know exercising, leave them alone.","If you’re driving down the street, and you see someone you know running/walking down the street for exercise, leave them alone.

1. do not beep your horn, especially if they do not see you coming, unless you want to give them a heart attack and embarrass them in public. At least for me, exercising in public isn’t always something I want to do because the last thing I want is people staring at me. Plus my heart is already racing as I’m running down the street. Don’t be a dick and scare people. 

2. Do not slow down your car to wave. You are impeding traffic and you’re going to make someone hit you. And please keep your eyes on the road, if you’re still moving but slowly you’re going to be swerving all over the place or stopping suddenly and cause an accident.

3. DO NOT STOP. Don’t pull over to have a conversation. They are exercising. They don’t want to talk to you at this moment. The entire conversation 99/100, they are just looking for a pause to leave and  waiting for you to stop talking so they can move on. They are sweaty and uncomfortable and probably just want to go home. Plus, once again, could cause an accident. 

4. Do not call them. They are exercising, most likely listening to music or something and probably breathing heavily. They don’t want to talk to you right now. I don’t care how many times you call me, I am running. I will block your call 45 times in a row if I have to, and respond to it when I feel I’m ready. Leaving a voicemail after the first call attempt is fine by the way; I, personally, am more likely to listen to a voicemail while I’m running (on occasion) and I will respond to it when I can. 

5. For the love of god, and I can’t believe I have to say this, don’t swerve and pretend to hit them. It’s happened to me more than once. It’s not funny, it’s never been funny. That’s a real thing I worry about while running outdoors. It’s dangerous in all many ways. Don’t do it.

308, Cultivating a Happy and Healthy Mindset (Subjective)(Long Guide),"This is a subjective guide to becoming a happy person. You get what you choose to get out of this post. While there are a couple of religious themes briefly touched upon, the nature of this post is not religious by any means, and would probably be better defined as philosophy. Regardless, the nature of this post isn't to sway you in any direction, but to instead break you free from anything that's holding you back in life. 

About Me:

I’m a military veteran who has struggled with anxiety, depression, insomnia, and adhd. I have tried various types of medication but disliked the various side-effects. I have found a method that works for me, and I hope for you, the same.

Many look for a key, item, person, or thing to make themselves happy. This is impossible because happiness is purely subjective, and one person’s happiness may differ from another person’s. This is a no-nonsense guide on how to find your own happiness, but as happiness is subjective, you will find you are not finding happiness, but creating happiness from within.

Perfection is impossible, this is a never ending process, so please be patient and give it at least 30 days before dismissing these suggestions entirely. Again, this is all subjective, you get to choose what you get out of these exercises.

Required Materials:

    Journal – I recommend the bullet journal method, but any will do
    
    Writing utensil – for your journal
    
    Proper Mindset – this will be cultivated over time

Before Starting:

    I highly recommend--I can not stress this enough--a proper sleep, yoga, and meditation routine. I will delve deeper into all three further in the reading.

Journaling:

    You will reflect on everything that you do during the day, from eating, to talking with friends. Write down everything you can, only writing down positive information. For example: “I drank tea today. I made sure to be mindful of every sip, tasting and smelling the fragrance of the tea. The warmth brought me a feeling of comfort. I am thankful for being able to afford such luxuries.”
    
    Remember, only write positive information in your journal. Be sure to write about everything that you can, especially the exercises in this guide.  

Power of Words:

    When you speak, your ideas are converted from thoughts to waves, and if they make it to a proper receiver, back to thoughts. When that information reaches the receiver, a metaphorical seed is planted in their brain. When you speak angry words, you are planting angry seeds in someone’s head, including your own. When you speak words of kindness and love, you will find that you can cultivate a beautiful garden.
    
    People are like mirrors, that’s why you should always treat others the way you would want to be treated. If you treat someone with kindness, they are more likely to be kind back. If you criticize or lecture someone, they will think it’s right for them to do the same back to you--no one likes to be lectured. If you make fun of someone, even in jest, you will find they will dish it right back to you, sometimes worse...
    
    When you say angry things, you will think angry things. When you think angry things, you will tend to say angry things. The same works for words of kindness and love. Try to refrain from swearing and violent thoughts and reflect in your journal whenever you catch yourself filtering your thougths. Be sure to thank yourself for your efforts using words of love and kindness.  

Sleep:

    You will find these exercises require a great deal of focus and mindfulness. Without adequate sleep, you will find these tasks to be more challenging than they should be. Many people put sleep on the bottom of their priorities, but I argue that sleep should be one of your highest priority, possibly second to food and water.
    
    Without adequate sleep, you aren’t able to think straight. Many know the feeling of being overtired, you tend to say and do things you wouldn’t do normally. It’s best to sleep at the same time everyday, but some professions do not allow for that kind of luxury. Try your best and thank yourself for your efforts.
    
    Going to bed at the same time every night will put your body into a routine. This is beneficial because you will start naturally feeling tired around bedtime. Having a night time ritual compounds this effect. For example, you may get a glass of water, use the bathroom, brush your teeth, change, and go to bed. Doing the same routine every night will prime your body for bedtime.  
    
    Ensure the bedroom is for sleep and sex only. It may be tempting to watch tv, play on your phone, etc, but you will teach your body that the bedroom is for play instead of sleep. It is also recommended you stop looking at screen at least an hour before bed, as the blue light from the screen disrupts melatonin production, your body’s natural response to absence of light, which primes you for sleep. You may find it difficult to practice these steps at first, but if you keep at it, you will find getting to sleep gets a lot easier.  

Yoga and Meditation:

    I do not want to dive too deep into explaining practices. I would advise that you take 30 minutes a day for yoga, and 30 minutes a day for meditation. Yoga teaches you how to control your body, and it releases tension in stress, making you overall more comfortable.  
    
    Yoga teaches you how to be with yourself. The best way I can describe meditation is that we often seek to escape our thoughts and ourselves, meditation makes you face yourself and find comfort within.  
    
    I recommend an illustrated yoga book as I have found better results going at my own pace as opposed to a video class. Please try both of these for 30 days. I’m begging you.

Perspective:

    A man was taking a shortcut through a field on a hot summer’s day to escape the heat. He steps in a cow pie and exclaims, “aww shit!” The fly on the cow pie says, “shit!? That was my lunch!”
    
    You can choose to be the man, or you can choose to be the fly in any situation. No, I’m not asking you to eat shit! Consider a hunter walking through the field instead. The hunter may step in the cow pie and feel excited knowing there’s food nearby! Consider a farmer, he’s probably used to stepping in pies all day long. The farmer may feel happy knowing the land is healthy and fertilized.
    
    You can feel any way you want about any situation, its all about perspective.

Zooming:

    There are more than 7 billion people on this planet, each with lives of their own. There have been billions that come before you, there will be billions that come after you. The universe has been around longer than our imaginations can truly comprehend, and it will be around even longer than that!  
    
    Our lives are just a blink of an eye in the grand scheme of things. If you look at the cosmos and zoom out, we are smaller than a grain of sand compared to everything else! If you’re upset, ask yourself, “will this matter in a year? Does this impact the grand scheme of the universe around me?” You will often find your answer is “no,” and that you were upset over nothing.

Anxiety and Depression:

    Anxiety is to worry about what’s next. Depression is to be disheartened by the past. You can’t predict the future, you can’t change the past, but you can live in the present and enjoy every moment of it. Know that you’re doing your best, the rest is up to the universe.  

Materialism and Money:

    Money is useful, I wont argue that. We have been raised to think that becoming a dragon and hoarding piles of wealth is the be-all and end-all of the world. It’s not. It’s not even close to as important as we make it out to believe. We are tricked into thinking we need to work 40hrs a week just to live, that’s ridiculous. What makes 40hrs of my time any more or less valuable than 40hrs of your time? Time is the most valuable commodity you have, you are worth more than you’ve been told. They need us more than we need them.
    
    If you had all the money you needed, and you bought whatever it was that you wanted, what would you buy next? Many do not know—I don’t know. Money is useful as an exchange for goods and services, but it does not make one happy, neither does buying everything.  
    
    Many have probably bought something to only throw it out or replace it in a short period. I’m sure buying that thing seemed like the best way to fill the emptiness in your heart, but in the end you only end up with an empty heart and an empty wallet.
    
    My advice, do what is necessary to live. If you cherish every second of your time, the happiness will come naturally. I am not saying you should live without comfort—that’s ridiculous.

The Biggest Lie:

    The biggest lies are the lies we convince ourselves into believing. The absolute biggest lie is our idea of identity. Consider an axe that has had its handle replaced. Is it the same axe? What if the head is also replaced? Each component is now different than the original, but some will still call it the same axe.
    
    Consider our bodies, comprised of little bits of matter we call “cells.” Most cells in your body get replaced regularly, so in a few years time, you will be comprised of completely new cells, yet we still consider ourselves the same. Your brain will create new pathways to memories and ideas that are used regularly and shut off pathway that are neglected. If you have brain damage, you will act like someone completely different, are you still you?
    
    We change every single moment, yet we hold on to ideas from the past. We force ourselves into these ever-narrowing roles such as computer programmer, lawyer, doctor, etc. People will bring up stories and actions from your past, confining you to those definitions, neglecting the fact that people change. If an idea no longer suits you, change it, get rid of it! They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again while expecting different results, yet we are the insane ones, stuck in the past, confining ourselves to silly labels.  
    
    If you no longer want to be a programmer, the class clown, the person who likes to play video games, etc, then stop. Simple as that. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise, no matter who they are. What made humans special in the first place was our ability to adapt.  
    
    We are not our bodies, as our bodies are forever changing. We are not what we think and feel because those are forever changing as well. We are the consequences of how we use our bodies and our minds.  

Breathing:

    Just as words can change the mind, and the mind can change the words that regularly come out of your mouth, your breath can change your mind, and your mind can change the way you breath. Anyone who has ever been jumped or scared knows that their heart rate and breathing rate will elevate, and then descend back to baseline when you calm down.  
    
    Take large, deep breaths. We tend not to use our full lung capacity. If you practice deep breathing, you will expand your capacity to breath, and realign your body. You will notice that you can’t take a full breath without proper posture. You can use your breath to correct your posture.
    
    Slowing your breathing will trick your brain into calming you down. Try it yourself. You will find this practice challenging at first, but with time and effort, you will make permanent changes. The use of a mantra is very beneficial because it stops you from thinking about other things and it creates a rhythm. I like to do the following:
    
    (breathing in)
    
    vessel, melon
    
    (breathing out)
    
    spirit, dwelling

and it looks like:

    (breathing in)
    
    ves...sel...mel...on…
    
    (breathing out)
    
    spir...it...dwel...ling…

The words begin to lose meaning, that’s when they work best. You can use anything you’d like!

Duality, Sides, Polarity:

    People get stuck on the small details when in reality they are arguing about the same thing. Take science and religion, for example. In science we are trying to find universal truth. In some religions, we declare God as the universal truth. If we crack science and find a mathematical law that runs the universe, couldn’t you just call that God? In the end you’ve achieved the same thing, right? If the universe can be described as a formula, you could argue that God is the formula, or the formula is God’s word, right?
    
    That was fun, let’s look at politics. If you ask a million people how they envision their ideal life, you will probably get a million different answers. We go overboard and look at fine-grain details like socialism vs capitalism. If you look at the big picture, everyone wants to live their life without other people infringing on their way of life. Whatever model you use, capitalism, socialism, anarchism, or something else, aims to do the same thing. I will not argue which is better, except that we are currently doing a poor job, but I will argue that people need to look at the big picture. They’re arguing about two sides of the same coin.  
    
    To reiterate, we all often want the same things, but we get too hung up on the fine details to realize we are arguing about the same idea.   

Control:

    Try this exercise: sit or lay down comfortably. Slow your breathing and use your mantra. Focus on each part of your body and then relax it. Imagine a bright ball of light above your head that is warm, comforting, brings you joy. Try to aim for pure bliss if possible. If you were successful, you may have felt—this is subjective—amazing! You may need to try other visualization techniques to achieve this effect, but I know it’s possible!
    
    With enough practice you can bring about any feeling of emotion you desire. You will find that your ability to do this strongly correlates to how much meditation and yoga you are doing. This is a useful tool that you can use anytime you’d like.
    
    Emotions are not discrete, they are a spectrum. Love and hate are on the same spectrum, but love and fear are not. You can change one emotion into another as long as they are on the same spectrum of emotion. This is tough and requires a high degree of mental fortitude. Remember, you can choose to be the fly, but don’t eat shit!
    
    You will find that even though you can shift how you feel, you may still find difficulty with negative emotions. Just like the universe around you, your emotions are in constant motion, like a wave. If a positive and negative experience meet, they neutralize. Two positive experiences will build you higher, and two negative experiences will take you lower. You can rise above a wave of emotion by remembering you are not your body or your mind, and that thoughts arise naturally without consent. You can then breath and use your mantra, calling on your positive feeling. This process mitigates how far you sway in one direction or the other. Use it well.

Before Jumping In:

    Please heed my advice, these processes work best with adequate sleep, yoga, and meditation practices. I can not stress this enough. REMEMBER TO WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN.  Be positive, if you can’t, make up a reason to be. 

Exercise 1 – Healing Water

    Before drinking water, slow your breath and say a mantra. Take a sip and hold the water in your mouth for one inhale/exhale cycle. While doing this, be thankful for that sip of water, imagine it rejuvenating and healing you. Swallow the water, and breath one more cycle.  
    
    This process will make you more mindful every time you drink and you will be able to use a sip of water as a moment to pause life, reflect, and be thankful.
    
    I find this works great with a cup of tea! Do the same as above, but don't stop the process until you finish your tea. This is a form of mindful meditation!

Exercise 2 – Thankfulness

    When you wake up, before bed, and before meals, take a pause. Slow your breath, give your thanks and gratitude, try to cultivate that feeling of bliss. This is basically praying. If you’re religious, pray to your God, if not, thank yourself, the universe, or the world around you.
    
    This process increases your feelings of gratitude and is another good way to take a pause.

Exercise 3 – Slow Eating

    We often eat too fast with distractions. Take your time. Take smaller bites, chew a certain number of times or breath for a certain number of times before swallowing each bite. Take each moment to reflect on how lucky you are to be eating, even if you’re well off, and how delicious the food is.
    
    You can also use this time to envision your body being repaired and energized by the food you’ve been eating. You will find that you can achieve any effect you desire.  

Exercise 4 – Time-based Prayer / Gratitude

    You may find it easier to take a moment of gratitude or prayer at certain times of the day. You could adapt a process similar to various religious traditions.  

Exercise 5 – A Higher Power

    Religious or not, this technique is incredibly effective. If you were to imagine that every single act you did was for a divine being, you will tend to practice mindfulness with ease. Do not mistake acting for a divine being as being directed or judged by a divine being. Think along the lines of paying tribute to the divine.
    
    This works best if you create a small list of virtues, think similar to the 10 commandments, but adapted for your needs. The more rules you have, the more rules that can be broken, and the harder it is to keep track of them. Try to be short and concise with little room for interpretation.

Exercise 6 – Sign from Divine

    This goes in hand with exercise 5. Imagine every little thing you encounter in life is a sign from some higher power. If you’re religious, this should hopefully come easy to you. Take anything, a gust of wind, a road sign, whatever you want,  just imagine its some divine power reaching out to you. Give it WHATEVER meaning YOU want, preferably positive.  
    
    With enough practice, you will find you can find meaning in literally everything.

Conclusion:

    I urge you all to practice and create exercises from the reading. This is almost like a DIY religion, but I would push more towards a philosophy. I borrowed ideas from various sciences and religious texts, none of these ideas are original to me. Please, please, please, use your journal and give this a shot.  
    
    You will find that you will be able to take hold of the reigns of life and give meaning to anything and everything while cultivating a healthy mindset. Be creative and own this process, it’s yours and no one can take it from you.  
    
    There are many more practices and exercises you can come up with, you will find that when you start on this path, you will gain momentum.

332," Many US hospitals have charity care programs, discounting your bill by up to 100%!","
Many US hospitals run financial assistance programs, often called “charity care”. These programs provide relief to those who owe on their bills after insurance pays - or if they don’t have insurance at all. I used to work for a large hospital in their collections department, and learned about these programs there. Given that medical debt is a leading cause of bankruptcy in the US, I thought I’d spread the word!

If you get a hospital bill you cannot pay, contact the hospital ASAP and ask to speak to a financial services staff member to inquire about applying for their charity care program. You’ll usually need the following:

Proof of income/unemployment (pay stub, bank deposit information)
Copy of your last Federal and State tax returns
Household info (how many people in your household and their ages)
Statement of your inability to pay

You might need additional information, like a copy of your lease or mortgage information, utility bills, and the like. 

Follow the application you receive precisely, and keep a copy for yourself. 

Many programs offer graduated relief, often up to 400% of poverty level income. For a family of 4 in the USA, that is $104,800. So - don’t think “I make too much to qualify” - you might not, and if you’re currently unemployed, including that information may influence your application. 

Another bonus: some hospitals may suspend collections on accounts once you apply for charity care. Even if you get denied, it will at least give you extra time to pay. 

Do not “just pay a little” every month in the hopes that you will avoid collections. That strategy doesn’t work, but working WITH the hospital and taking advantage of their programs certainly can!

And - not only did I work in the system, I just used to my benefit. I had surgery in March and was furloughed from my job in April. Just got notified my ENTIRE remaining balance was paid off by this sort of program!",LifeProTips,liand22,10,1,2020-07-16

339, Blackmail,"There is good and bad in everyone and everything. Sometimes we get tempted by the bad. Perhaps a day comes when you give in to the temptation.

Unfortunately you were not smart enough to look around first. make sure no cameras or people looking at you.

Soon, you are contacted. The person says they know the bad thing you did and they will tell everybody unless you do this bad thing. You say okay then they say now i know two bad things you did and i will tell everybody etc. etc. 

You're trapped. Now there are only two ways out. First: kill the blackmailer. Yay, no more blackmail. Boo, twenty years in prison.

Second: Say: Okay. You got me. I was stupid enough to not look around before doing something bad and now you will blackmail for the rest of my life. 

Well, what I am going to do now is: I am going to contact every person I know on earth and I am going to tell them the bad thing I did. Some will hate me forever and never speak to me again. Some will be angry for a long time and eventually forgive me. Some will say meh, you're human.


But first, before I tell them what I did, I am going to tell them what you did. Everybody will hate you and no one will ever want to know you again. You will always be alone because nobody ever wants to know a blackmailer. Have a nice life. 

Then you turn around and walk away. There is a possibility that as you are walking, you will hear........Wait! If you promise not to tell anyone, I will do anything you want.


At this point, you might choose to say ""Okay. First I want you to rob a bank and bring me all the money. Second, go to the police and tell them you robbed the bank and you can't remember where the money is.""",LifeProTips,hi1im2shy3,7,1,2020-07-16

Based off that, put the band-aid stretching from ""left to right"" (medial to lateral). Of course, this doesn't totally prevent crinkling, but it may help reduce it.

An example where this works almost perfectly is the palm of your hand. If you have a cut or similar on your palm, avoid putting the band-aid from right to left (pinky-side to thumb-side), because this is the way your hand naturally moves.

Credit where it's due - upvote their comment please if you agree.

There are specific and hopefully rare times when you should not do this, such as in business if you're escalating an issue and want your boss to hear the other person's perspective without filters.  And this can sometimes be painful in large conference calls (again, mostly in business) when your room is large or time has to be kept short. For those, you can say ""I have others with me"" or ""I have representatives from group-X here with me"" at the start of the call instead.

But in general, in both business and social events, you just never know when something is going to get blurted out by someone on your phone and that can be hurtful or shocking or insulting to whoever's on the other line. And it doesn't have to be clumsy either. For example: ""Hey, I'm diving with PersonX to the beach, and wanted to ask you something.""

427,LPT don't listen to non veterinarians on making veterinary medical decisions.,"In response to the euthanasia post, I wanted to offer an opinion from an actual vet.  As a vet I have had to euthanize hundreds of pets. It infuriates me to no end to hear people shaming or scaring people into believing they need to be there in their pets final moments if they are not comfortable or emotionally capable of being there. The statement that pets who are left alone frantically look for their owners is simply not true. Pets that are being euthanized are almost always too sick to be overly concerned with who is around them. If anything, having owners present who are not comfortable being their makes everything worse for the pet. Your pet knows your emotions and responds/ reacts to you. If you are in a panic because watching your pet being euthanized is more than you can handle, your pet is going to panic with you. As a vet I have NEVER judged an owner who felt they couldn't be with their pets. The only people I judge are those individuals who are seeking convenience euthanasia, who I then decline services to. Another point: for euthanasia, whether you choose to be present or not, in almost all cases we vets will choose to give pets a sedative and analgesic prior to performing the actual euthanasia. After these medications are administered, patients are typically on cloud nine and are not at all concerned with who or what is happening around them. So to recap. Do not take shitty second or third hand advice off the internet when it comes to important medical decisions. Do not let idiots on the internet guilt you and effect your mental health. If you are unsure about what you are comfortable with when it comes to euthanasia, ASK YOUR VET for advice, then make the right choice for YOU.

Spotify has it's own separate EQ, under Settings &gt; Playback &gt; Equalizer (I use Rock)

When you open the equalizer, you'll see a sort of line-graph with a bunch of sliders you can adjust. The left side is the low frequency/bass tones. Increasing these will give your headphones/speakers more boom. Turn this down if the bass is too much and drowns out the middle tones. (Decreasing these sliders can also save battery life on headphones)

The middle sliders are for the mid tones, which can be adjusted to make the music clearer or louder in general.

The right side of the EQ are the high tones (high notes). If your music sounds like it's being played through a tin can, adjust these sliders way down.

Play a song and adjust the equalizer to your liking, or choose from the presets. You'll be amazed at how much better your music sounds when you tailor your EQ to your speakers. Even cheap sets can sound much better if you choose the right EQ!",LifeProTips,jsaosb123,7,4,2020-07-15

494, Burn your food.,"This seems contrary to what most people think you ""should"" do in cooking.  However with chicken, steak, pork, and most veggies if you're cooking in a pan you want to have your heat on relatively high and sear the meat on both sides.  Use oil with a small pad of butter.  It locks in the juices and preserves moisture inside the meat.  Don't worry about the meat sticking to the pan when you lift it either.  If it doesn't want to lift out of the pan immediately let it cook a little more until you can flip it to the other side without ripping off too much of whatever side you're cooking.  After cooking both sides and removing the meat, pour some chicken stock, beef stock (usually use the opposite stock of what you're cooking) and it will de-glaze the pan of all the burnt bits.  

This is known as the maillard reaction and intensifies the flavor of everything you cook.  Burnt is good, burnt is flavor, burnt is life.

If you want to surprise someone you care about, it isn't a ""bigger surprise"" if you pretend that nothing is happening (a la recent TIFU post). Instead, give the person the opportunity to prepare for something and then have that something turn out to be much better than they were expecting.

If you are going out for dinner, don't tell the person you are going to a cheap restaurant and then surprise them with a Michelin Star restaurant, for example. They won't dress appropriately, and then they will feel out of place the entire time. The surprise will actually backfire on you and can make the person feel worse than if it didn't happen at all.

Or if it is a big party with lots of their friends, coworkers, or whatever, don't tell the person to come over for Netflix &amp; Chill. They may come over in comfy clothes and then feel awkward around the other people.

For a surprise party at your place, I suggest something like ""Can you come over for a special evening? I want to make you dinner. Even though we aren't going out, it might be nice to dress up and be a little formal.""

After reading this LPT, I checked my body and saw two moles that violate the ABCDE rules described in that thread. I saw a dermatologist and she said they look safe (still proceeded to remove one of them out which was at a spot where it's hard to monitor. She told me to monitor the other one and see if it grows and took a picture of the mole for me so I can compare)

In this situation I can't do anything safely to get them to back off so I get stressed out and distracted. 

My solution to this is to angle my rear view mirror slightly upwards so that I can't see them when I'm relaxed in the drivers seat. If I need to use the rear view mirror for reversing I can just straighten up or stretch in the seat a little to see out.

This reduces my stress levels while driving and I don't get distracted.

In every possible scenario where you are driving safely and someone hits the back end of your car with theirs because they were too close or not paying attention, they are in the wrong and you are not to blame.

1) Fear of embarrassment
2) Lack of practice dealing with large audiences

It’s the same concept as an athlete imagining a game-winning play. If you can’t visit the venue, really any venue works.

692," when a ""charity"" calls you, tell them that you're unavailable for the present moment, but you'd like to read more information on their website (to assert dominance)","A lot of scam calls are charities claiming to want your information to donate money to charity. Like many scam calls, you can either hang up, or try \[and probably fail\] into politely getting the caller into hanging up on you by insisting that no, you do not want to donate money.

If you're someone that struggles with being rude, and you're specifically dealing with a charity scam, just ask them to tell you their website name so that you read about them and/or donate when you have time.

This accomplishes the following:

* The ball is swung back into their side of the court, so the pressure is on them to progress the conversation instead of you
* You don't sound like a dick, because any legitimate charity in this century absolute *should* have a website
* If they don't immediately conclude the conversation (which I've had happen) and dodge the question or say that they don't have a website, insist that you won't donate without checking out their website first. You are being more overt here, but they've also outed themselves as being a scam for not complying with a simple and standard request. At this point, they'll probably wrap up the conversation. If, by some off-chance, they turn more aggressive (which never happened to me), then hang up if you have the confidence.

I do realize that many scam callers are just people trying to get by in this world like anyone else, so it's tough for me to just tell someone to piss off for trying to get bread on the table. If there's nothing else for me to say, I will say ""have a good day, sir/ma'am"" and hang up. However, I'm also not the most socially anxious person in the first place either, so I know this is easier said than done for many.

If you aren't close to the person, don't let them cook you anything, especially if you're a picky eater. You're expected to finish all of the food and it would be impolite to waste what they specially made for you. To avoid situations where you have to force yourself to eat something you hate, just politely decline their offer by saying ""Thanks a lot, but I'm already full.""

You should also refrain from pointing and asking about family photographs when you don't know about a person's relationship with their family members. This can save a lot of awkward and uncomfortable situations.

Also, some homes have religious altars or things of that sort. Don't carelessly point, touch the offerings, and be sensitive of what you say.

Another thing to note is that you shouldn't rummage through their things, pick up their instruments or touch their books, at least without permission. This one's obvious. Sometimes, those things might belong to other family members. You might end up breaking fragile things on accident, or mess up the orderliness of the place. Ask them where you can place your belongings, ask them if you can sit on your chair or on your bed. If they disapprove of what you're doing, they probably wouldn't sound out to you in order to be a hospitable host.

816, Do not work yourself to death to please a boss that doesnt like you. Dont take shit from a bad boss... ever.," 

I  have had some great bosses, some ordinary bosses and some stupid greedy  and childish ones. But the worst boss to have is one that makes your  life miserable and doesn't give a shit or is a narcissistic psychopath

In  this situation, you need to recognise that your boss is never going to  like you, even if you went licked them clean, brought them lunch every day and did their dirty knickers. They may keep wanting you to do these things, but to them, you are just a piece of disposable garbage.

 So dont bother trying to please them. Work harder? Will never  fly. I even had one of my bosses come into my office in a rage as soon  as she arrived (at 10am) and shrieked at me to NEVER AGAIN send her work  emails (to her work account) in the middle of the night. She told me she doesnt care how busy I am, just fucking get on with it.

The  best thing to do in a bad boss situation is to never take shit. If they treat you like crap, call  them out and tell them that if it happens any more that you will make a contemporaneous note or  something. A lot of times these people have had complaints before but  for one reason or another they aren't sacked. But they will always be  aware that another complaint might be the straw that broke the camels  back.

  
NEVER trust HR. They aren't there for you and any sympathy you  may experience from them is only so they can get some dirt on you or  information that allows them to spin things. Get someone independent if you need a lawyer, human rights or a psychologist.

Take  note of every nasty interaction, along with times dates and any  witnesses, even if it means that your work falls behind. 

Never take  up any offer by the company of their own counselling or mental health  services. They are not for you either and will actively undermine any  credibility a subsequent complaint you may lodge.

Understand  that, if things go pear shaped, then you are on your own. Any sympathetic colleagues will disappear overnight or sooner. With that in  mind, understand that busting your balls to excel or impress in your  workplace boss or any higher ups is absolutely worthless. Work to improve or impress yourself,  nobody else gives a fuck.",LifeProTips,Bobsledtohell,12,26,2020-07-14

829," People who want to start meditation, always start after stretching your muscles well and pick up routines for three minutes.","Hi. 

I see a lot of folks saying that they are unable to meditate as they can't calm themselves down or they aren't able to finish the session as mentioned by their trainer or the application they follow. 

Meditation, like any other activity that you'd pursue in your life, requires certain prerequisites before you are able to start doing it right. Don't consider your day-1 a failure and stop altogether. 

Everyday you fail at a new thing, is Day 0.

Here are the tips for absolute newbies or people who are struggling with starting.

1. Meditation need not be the first activity of your day. You can always have freshen up and decide to meditate. 
2. Do the basic stretching of your arms, legs, neck etc in standing posture and work yourself up before you decide to finally sit down to meditate. 
3. Pick a 3 minute routine from any app of your choice. You might not be able to meditate 3 minutes. Split that to 3 parts.

Part A : The part that you prepare yourself to meditate. Over here, you're mostly listening to what the guide in your guided meditation set says. 

Part B : The part oyu believe you've got it and are able to focus. 

Part C : The part where you are waking up. 

Don't be frustrated with the part A and C. They are apparently the most important parts of meditation. It is a slow emphasis of how you prepare to deal with something and how to do you act once that is done. 

If ever you feel that you are doing it wrong, understand, it's still Day 0 and you can always revisit day 0.",LifeProTips,daxaaryan,2,7,2020-07-14

""Your opinion doesn't matter."" Did that make you feel small? Worthless? Silenced? That's a form of verbal abuse.

Sometimes the abuse isn't as obvious. Maybe it's the constant blame, constant critiques, constant ""this is what a good girlfriend/daughter/sister/friend should say/do and you don't fit the mold, aka my expectations."" If what they say makes you feel less than, humiliated, insulted, demeaned, inadequate, or ashamed, you might be a victim of emotional abuse.

838, order your burial chamber before death to save big money,"Since this pandemic has been raging in my country, and since I've had to do this for both parents pre-pandemic, I thought I would share this LPT.  Its coming in handy as my in laws are nearly dead, for they are now walking brain dead zombies who believe wearing a mask is an affront to their rights.

If you find yourself as the executor of an estate handling the burial details, you should know that you generally get very little time to select the burial chamber for the deceased, be it a cremation urn or casket.  When selecting these items through your crematorium or funeral home, the markup on the chambers is ludicrous.  You can save thousands of dollars by just planning ahead a bit.

You can buy very nice urns and caskets online for huge savings, but the catch is you need to do this in advance as it may take weeks to receive your chamber.  The morgues here will not want to retain the corpse for you that long and will require you to do things and spend lots of money transferring the corpse around..  every time they move the corpse to another facility will generally result in a steep transfer fee.  Yes, thousands of dollars to move the body if only a few miles.  Every move.  Think about this carefully.  If you don't already have the casket, you'll probably buy one on the spot because of course, no time and your probably grieving.  

Order early if you have elderly loved ones behaving recklessly.

Some tips to stay safe:

1. **Don't** post about or discuss your big order on social media. This includes sending invites or polls for ""What kind of food should we have?""
2. *Do* limit the number of people you discuss the order with and where you discuss it, such as talking about needing 30 pizzas in a public space or mass-texting all your friends instead of just your BFF.
3. *Do* split up large orders. At the very least, use different locations for the same restaurant chain (ie; Pizza Hut) Consider ordering the same thing from *different restaurants - 3* pizzas from Pizza Hut and 3 pizzas from Godfathers is less eyebrow-raising than 6 from either one.
4. **Don't** pay with a credit card that's linked directly to a bank account. If they give you too much crap about paying with cash, buy a prepaid Visa card, then place your order with THAT.
5. **Don't** threaten the workers. Especially not over the phone. This not as likely to work as you think. They've heard it all before and often they're already too poorly paid/treated to care about threats.
6. *Do* ""tip"" generously. It's 100% legal and works a lot better than #5.

984,LPT REQUEST: Sometimes You Just Need to Walk it Out,"Sometimes you just need to walk it out

Hey there. Back again are we? Yeah, we all know this spot too well. Stuck between a rock and a hard place. To put it simply, you just can’t make up your mind. Hell, you haven’t a clue what it is you actually want. You can’t even tell what you need at this point.

Every time you try to do something it just doesn’t feel right. You even try to change the lighting and the music and oh my god now music doesn’t even sound good anymore, it’s not even natural! How did we get here?!? Please somebody let me out... please, someone just hold me. Ugh...

Yeah, we all know this one. Some of us more than others. And we don’t always have someone there to hold us and comfort us through it. Nor do we always have someone to talk to and show us the way out. Well, allow me to offer a rather simple solution to help grease the wheels a bit. 

Just. Start. Walking.

Press pause on the horror show you’ve found yourself in, ignore the racing thoughts, don’t feed into the elevating emotions. Put some shoes on, walk out the door, and just start walking. Your mind is going to tell you it’s dumb. Your body is gonna try to make you feel like you wanna go back inside and sit down. Push through it. And just walk. No matter what else happens internally, just keep walking.

Literally like Dory from Finding Nemo, “just keep swimming”. Eventually, whatever it was that seemed to bother you so very much just happens to... wait... what were we talking about again?

Sometimes you just have to walk it out. Sometimes all it takes is a loop around the old block.

P.S. It helps to breathe deeply through the nose.

1001, Keep your smartphone/tablet/labtop battery level between 40 and 80% as much as possible if you want to extend its life,"It might sound weird, mainly because there's lot of misconceptions going around about how we should treat batteries but, trust me, this has been confirmed by experts numerous times (by people I met IRL and videos/article I've seen online):  


Modern lithium batteries weaken a little bit more anytime you fill them up, mostly everyone agrees on that. But what you might not be aware of, is that batteries suffer much more from both low and very high levels than it does from average levels. So you're definitely better be charging your device several times per day in order to keep it between 40 and 80% rather than waiting for it to get lower than 15% and then filling it up to 100%. Lots of people still think batteries should be charged to the top, but it is definitely wrong.  


If, like me, you're concerned about your phone running out of juice during the night because your alarm might not ring in the morning, just switch it to airplane mode and make sure your battery is at least 40%. It will barely drop during the night if you do that, trust me.

Concerning labtops, the best thing to do is to keep it plugged when you can and to lock the battery level at an average percentage (lke 60-70%). You should usually be able to lock the battery level in your OS settings. Why keeping it plug and not removing the battery like some people do ? Because when your laptop is done with charging the battery it will only use energy from the plug no matter if a battery is in. And using a computer directly on a plug without battery is risky because it there's a power cut, you computer could be damaged. 

Off course if you're listening to this advice there will be times when you'll not be able to keep it between 40 and 80% and that's ok. The thing is to do it as much as you can to extend your battery life, but when on certain occasions you definitely need it to last longer than usual, you can charge it full.",LifeProTips,ralconealkavery,5,1,2020-07-13

1055, How to build your credit if you have none.,"This is intended for young people looking to build their credit and improve their scores or those who are not in serious debt.

1. Sign up for credit monitoring. Credit Karma is free.
2. Make sure there are no old debts on there, no matter how small the amount! It affects your credit score. Whatever you pay off when you pay be sure to remind them to take it off your credit report. Once everything is paid off, continue to step 3.
3. Apply for a secured credit card. Usually, you have to pay a deposit, most companies will ask for a deposit of $100 and your credit line is $200 (don’t worry you get it back after 1 year).
4. This step is important. Keep your credit card usage under 10% every month. This means if your credit limit is $200 than never spend more than $20 a month. The key is spending about $18 EVERY month and paying it on time EVERY month. Each month you keep it under 10% and pay it off every month. Each month you do this, points will be added to your score.
5. Be patient and do this for about a year.
6. You get your deposit back yay! Still maintain your 10% card utilization (they may increase the limit).
7. Apply for a 2nd credit card once your score is at least 650. Do your research on which card, be sure to apply to a company that is okay with fair to bad credit. Each time your credit history is pulled you lose points so don’t risk it.
8. Also, keep this at 10%, you should have a higher credit limit like 2-3k.
9. Repeat steps 4 &amp; 5. Keep utilization under 10% and pay your bill EVERY month on time.
10. Your credit score should be in the lower 700’s, if not wait until then (if you reach this before a year is up that’s okay too). Now apply for one more card. Again, do your research, try to pick one with perks you can use like travel points or whatever. This limit should be 7-8k or more or less, either way, your limit will be a lot higher than the previous card.
11. Your score will drop a little and start growing again because of the credit history pull.
12. Your credit score grows because of the amount of credit, card utilization, and payment history.
13. Within a few months, you should be in the 750s aka excellent or above. Now you can purchase a car with a low-interest rate or buy a home and not worry about getting denied (as long as you meet the income requirements). During this time avoid ANY bills reaching collections, it will undo all your work. A little tip: no matter how big the bill is, as long as you pay something (anything) every month, it won’t go to collections.

I hope this helps someone, I did this and gained 200 points in a couple of years myself. I also helped a friend and they did it in 3. It is imperative to keep notifications on and view our score every month. Good luck :)",LifeProTips,mila_e860,19,1,2020-07-12

1073, You can make a searchable archive that works offline for any information you find interesting and might want to call upon at a later date,"I've been saving screenshots of things I find interesting to my phone for years. I always tell myself that when I need the information again I can scroll back through my various albums to find it, but I very rarely do. It takes a long time to scroll through thousands of images and a lot of text-based screenshots look the same at a glance anyway. Recently, I hit upon an idea.

My favourite unnamed communication platform uses a green speech bubble icon and is owned by a cyborg. It won’t let you send messages to yourself, but it *will* let you make a group with yourself and just one other person. Once you've created the group you can remove the other person and, suddenly, you have a way to send messages to yourself.

Now, every time I come across interesting information that I might want to use in the future, I can screenshot or download it and send it to my one-man chat.

***But wait, there's more!***

In the top right-hand corner of any chat held via this communication platform there's a drop-down menu with a search function. You can type in any word or phrase you vaguely remember saying whilst chatting to someone and you will be shown a list of all the times you've used it.

So every time I send myself something interesting I caption it with a keyword description. E.g., for a screenshot of a graphic showing the difference between a million, a billion and a trillion, I sent it with the caption ""million, trillion, billion; large numbers; debt; budget; borrowing; Bezos, Gates, Arnault, wealth"". (This isn’t a statement of any kind, just a broad list of conversation topics that might lead to me wanting to pull up the diagram).

The cool thing is that since you can download the cache to any device, all the content is there for you to search even if you're offline.

So regardless of whether you're in a tunnel, on an aeroplane or adrift at sea, you can open the app and instantly track down anything your past self deemed useful. Be it a visual guide to performing infant CPR, Thought Catalog's ""Top 10 Pickup Lines For Every Type Of Guy Out There"", a meme about a zebra from 2015, a Russian language declension chart, or that explanation of how to unblock your nose, it's at your fingertips.

Go forth and accumulate!

Since 2010, I've maintained a playlist called 'Themes'. Every 3-6 months, I add a new song following these rules:

- it's a song I've recently discovered
- I've been listening to it on repeat
- it captures how I've been feeling (to some degree, at least)
- once it's on the list, it stays on the list (no takebacks)

This has given me a 2-hour timeline of just about every stage of my life for the last ten years. I can listen through it and remember exactly where I was, who I was with, what I was going through, and how I was feeling in that time. Some of the songs are still my favourites, others less so, but they all bring back memories.

Simply put, present bias is giving more weightage to payoffs that are closer to the present time when considering an option between two future pay-offs.

This bias is strong when one of the options is very close to the present. However, it is not a big factor if both the options are far away from present but are closer to each other. For example, if someone tells you that you’ll get $100 after 100 days but $110 after 101 days, you are more likely to take the $110 dollars. But if it was a question of $100 today vs $110 tomorrow, chances are you will take the $100 today.

- Less confrontational and aggressive, allowing both you and the recipient to process it all calmly

1308," If you just graduated and are having trouble finding a job, staffing agencies are the secret to getting your foot in the door at many companies","After graduating a few years ago, I spent months applying to jobs with basically no luck, either not meeting the qualifications or not getting any response at all. At one point, though, I saw an ad on Craigslist for a staffing agency that was looking for entry-level science positions, so I gave them a call. In a few days, I had an interview, and within two weeks, they had me in a temp-to-hire job (meaning you start as a temp for some period of time and then the company has the option to hire you afterwards, which they nearly always do as long as you're competent).

When this happened, I told two of my friends who were having the same struggle, and they had jobs within a month. And our temp positions all went to become full-time salaried positions within six months. I realized that so many companies will just not hire entry-level employees directly anymore. This doesn't seem to be restricted to one field either; I graduated with Bachelor's in a science field, and my friends had degrees in creative and humanities fields.

I had to figure this out on my own because nobody tells college grads this, so I evangelize about this to anyone who's struggling to find a job (I was inspired to make this post after seeing this [starter pack](https://www.reddit.com/r/starterpacks/comments/hp2y62/post_college_job_search_starter_pack/)). I won't claim that it's guaranteed to get you a job, but it will at least give you a better chance. To find one in your area, I would recommend just googling ""staffing agencies"" but there are also some specialized ones so you may want to try prefixing with your general field like ""science staffing agency"" or ""creative staffing agency"".

One caveat about staffing agencies is that you'll be working for the agency, not the actual company, until you get a full-time hire. You'll most likely technically be paid the same as an actual employee of the company, but the agency will take some percentage of that as a fee before it gets to you. But in exchange, the company will basically do the application process for you and do everything they can to get you the job, since that's how they make their money. And as long as you're decent at your job, you'll most likely get hired at the end (as long it's a temp-to-hire position).",LifeProTips,DiscountConsistent,20,1,2020-07-11

This would go so far that when I would get my students to play back the song I gave them to learn between lessons, it would sometimes sound like a totally different song.

I would get my students to learn the finger placement and picking technique first and very slowly. Once they could remember the notes, if they didn’t naturally start playing in the song’s rhythm, then we would work on forcing the notes to match the rhythm of the song slowly, before ramping up the speed to full tempo and then at an increased tempo to build their confidence with the song.

I always thought a person who has mastered a song is somebody who can play it fast, slow, off rhythm, in various styles and in any key.

By toxic friend I mean someone who you regard as your friend, but doesn't do anything friends are supposed to. I knew a guy I thought was my best friend. But towards the end of the friendship he was acting like he was way better than me.

This made me feel I wasn't good enough and was lucky enough to have him as a 'best friend'. It really destroyed my confidence.

Please don’t point out the fact that they apologize too often. This will just make them feel more insecure and abnormal. Please don’t be hard on these people at all because more often than not these people need reassurance not ridicule.",LifeProTips,yo_gabba_gavin,19,1,2020-07-10

1366," Put your laundry away as you fold it. And for that matter, fold it as it gets done.","I know I'm not the only one who's fallen into the trap of ""I'll fold and put everything away at once,"" only to find... Oh man, there was more laundry than I thought, and now I'm too overwhelmed to know where to start. 

Whether the issue that affects your ability to do laundry is depression, time constraints, distractions, children, or just pure laziness, I've found that this method helps me a LOT. Especially since having my son (now 10mo). 

When you take the laundry out of the dryer, start folding. Even if you only get 3-4 pieces done, that's 3-4 things you don't have to do later. Throw the rest into the basket, put away what you just folded, and go to your next task (even if it's just watching TV).

Later when you walk by the basket again, repeat this process. Fold a few things until you can't for whatever reason, and put them away. 

Even if you've decided to set aside some time to fold it all at once, don't just make piles on the bed. Put each item away as you fold them, or do a small stack if there's a bunch of things in a row that'll go to the same place. That way, if something comes up that causes you to have to walk away, you're not left with the conundrum of having piles of folded clothes to deal with. (Especially if, like me, you have cats who like to knock them onto the floor constantly!!)

If nothing else, this'll help you get some extra steps in, too. It's not much in the way of exercise, but every little bit helps!

It's better to chip away at your laundry bit by bit than to leave it piled up. Much less falling into a trap I have time and time again that involves giving up halfway through, throwing the folded clothes on top of the basket, and then having to sort THAT whole mess out later. 

Fold your laundry as it comes out of the dryer. Or at least some of it. 

Put your laundry away as soon as you fold it. Each piece.

1444,LPT REQUEST : How to fix an inverted sleep cycle?,"I'm writing this on my second day in which I've got less than 3 hours of *night* sleep. 

Description of condition : I can usually go to sleep at 12-ish am which is kind of early for me. However for the last 2 days I've been getting up just 2-3 hours after I sleep and I can literally not go back to sleep. 
Once I wake up and try to force myself to go back to sleep, I honestly feel like I get more anxious that I won't be able to go back to sleep which will result in me being sleepy and less productive during the day due to which I won't be able to study well. 
So now I will end up being awake from 3am to around 12pm. Then at around 1pm I get tired and fall asleep till 6pm. Then stay awake from 6pm to 12am, and the cycle continues. 


Today I'm planning on not sleeping at all during the day, so essentially forcing myself to say awake till around 9-10pm. I'm hoping that I would be so sleep deprived that I would be able to sleep well from 10pm-6am and since I'm well rested, I won't feel the need to sleep during the day the next day. 
Is this a good way of fixing my sleep cycle? 

Is there anything else i could do to fix my sleep cycle?

I sent emails to all indicating a healthy modest ongoing work increase. All lenders were repaid in full vs taking cents on the dollars thru debt recovery as several had threatened.

1496," Rather than make huge changes to your lifestyle annually (New Year's Resolutions), make them monthly, less aggressive, and more focused. Use this month to solve a problem you have or start working towards some goal and integrate a solution into your permanent routine.","I like to give each of my monthly resolutions code-names and treat them like missions. Having a name for the resolution also gives me a mental handle for the goal and makes it easier to stay on track. Resolutions that have a daily quota have been especially effective for me. As examples, here are the monthly resolutions that I've integrated into my own routine thus far:

# April was ""Operation Motion""

* **Problem**: I'm a programmer who has been working from home. I had recently quit my day-job, which was my last good source of physical exercise.
* **Solution**: I started an incremental workout routine. On day one, I did one pushup, one sit-up, one squat, one jumping jack, ran in place for one second... etcetera. I then did two reps/seconds every day for two days, then three every day for three days, four for four, and so on. I'm currently at fourteen reps/seconds every day.
* **Outcome**: Successful, but still ongoing. I have never been so physically fit. The main reason for this success can be explained in three points: **1**. No cheat days, ever. The workout cannot be waived unless I'm physically ill, which has only let me skip two days out of the currently elapsed 110 days. **2**. If I forget to do my workout one day, I have to catch up on the missed reps the next day, always. **3**. I have a repeating alert in Thunderbird on my desktop to do my workout once a day, and I am not allowed to dismiss it until I've done it.

# May was ""Operation Night-Light""

* **Problem**: I've been staying up to 4-AM and beyond sometimes while working on projects or just watching videos. Consequentially, I was getting up as late as 1 PM since I no longer had a day-job to keep my sleep cycle in check.
* **Solution**: When 4-AM hits, unless it's a work emergency or I physically can't, I must go to bed. I must also wake up no later than 11-AM.
* **Outcome**: I'm wired to wake up late and stay up late. I've accepted that, but this has done a good job of keeping me in check and preventing me from going to bed after dawn. Having a program that dims your screens and emulates sunset colors helps. I also have a light-alarm that I wake up to in the morning which made the transition easier.

# June was ""Operation Reminder""

* **Problem**: My job at home involves me manually checking up on a wide number of spreadsheets and sites to perform routines. For things I haven't found a way to automate yet, some of these tasks are often forgotten for a few days.
* **Solution**: Every time I thought of a manual checkup routine that I needed to do, I'd add a repeating event with a reminder to my calendar in Thunderbird. I spent a fair bit of time that month figuring out what frequency the reminders should be set to so as to avoid doing excessive checks for things that don't change often or are low priority.
* **Outcome**: Things have been better, but sometimes I check a thing or two that I've already dismissed reminders for and it wastes a bit of time.

# July is ""Operation Good Start""

* **Problem**: My ADHD medication suppresses my hunger, but since it's extended release, I need to take it as soon as I wake up so that it wears off soon enough for me to get proper sleep. I've gotten into a bad habit of taking it with a glass of chocolate milk in the morning and not getting a proper breakfast.
* **Solution**: Eat a proper breakfast every morning, dummy.
* **Outcome**: Thus far I've been eating better but now I'm missing out on lunch. I should probably setup alarms to remind myself to eat since it just doesn't come to mind. ^(I'm going to do that right now, actually. Done.)

I hope that these monthly resolutions of mine are a good example. What is it that plagues you the most right now? What change have you been thinking about making on occasion but haven't put into motion? Think of a solution for it right now and start on it right now, even if it's a partial solution. Bonus points if you give it a cool name.

If you can think of a solution that involves a daily quota or goal, then definitely use that solution. Harness external tools such as calendars with automated reminders and make it a permanent part of your routine. Most importantly, respect the streak. If you do break the streak, un-break it if possible by catching up.

However, whatever you do, **do not use breaking the streak as an excuse to break the streak again.** If you cheat once, and use that as justification to cheat again, then you lose. Don't make your solution so aggressive that you can't help but cheat. Understand your limits, plan around your flaws, and you will succeed.",LifeProTips,Victuracor,17,1,2020-07-10

1548," If you want collections people to stop calling you, simply tell them so. They are required by law to stop if asked, and can be fined if they don’t. (Bonus: how to get creditors to accept a low settlement offer)","There’s no need to keep ducking those collections calls. From personal experience back when I was active in my addiction (alcohol and pain pills, almost 4 years sober now), I know how it feels to cringe when you see the 800 numbers on your phone and think that you have no way to get them to stop hounding you. This isn’t the case. 

According to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), if you request that a debt collector stop contacting you completely, they must do so (with only a very few exceptions). While the act states the request must be in writing, almost every one I’ve dealt with personally and for my clients (since becoming sober, I’ve been able to get my license to practice law) will stop calling if you verbally ask them to stop. 

If they **do** require it in writing, they have to give you the address to send the letter to when asked, and all the letter has to state is your desire to not be contacted again, your name, address, and number (and account number, if you have it handy).

Obviously, this doesn’t make your debt go away. It does prevent them from incessantly hounding you, though, and decreases their options. Unless you owe a **lot** (as in, 6k+) it’s unlikely they’ll sue on the debt. Also, it will prevent them from contacting you with a potentially favorable settlement offer (sometimes they’ll go as low as 20-30% of the original amount, which can be useful if you’re trying to clean your credit score up for a major purchase. 

However, I’ve personally had success with getting them to go for a low settlement offer by 1) requiring them to stop calling, 2) waiting 6+ months, 3) calling in to say you’re interested in settling, but only have X amount to work with, and if they can make it work then you’ll settle.. otherwise you’ll just forget all about them. This worked really well for me when I was having to clean my credit up to pass the character and fitness portion of becoming an attorney - I settled $16k of debt across 3 creditors for around $3700. Basically, I called each one and said I had just gotten my $1200 stimulus check and was thinking of using it to pay them off via settlement, but since it had been so long, I was thinking of just forgetting about the debt.. that it had been several years since it was originally incurred, and there was no real benefit to paying them, other than that it felt like it was the right thing to do. If they wanted the money, fine... but I couldn’t go higher than 1200, because I was impacted by corona and this is all I can spare since it’s “free money”. One debt was 5000, and they they settled for 1000 *even after I told them I would pay 1200*. Which is nuts. Another was 4000, they took 1200. The last was 7000 and they took 1500. 

If you don’t want to pay anything, I highly recommend pulling your credit scores (you can do this free on the government website (‘free credit report’ or something like that) a few times a year) and disputing **every single derogatory item**. Sometimes the creditors don’t respond to the dispute, and after a certain amount of days of no response, the derogatory items are automatically removed. I would try this method first, because you literally have nothing to lose by attempting it. Before I bought my house, I disputed everything that was bad over and over and over. Sometimes they apparently lost track and didn’t respond, so it was removed.

Anyway, hope this helps even one person out there.",LifeProTips,diverareyouok,16,9,2020-07-09

Go to your power options, click on your power plan, and click ""Change Plan Settings"", then ""Changed Advanced Power Settings"". Go under ""Processor Power Management"" in the dropdowns, select ""Maximum Processor State"", and set both battery and plugged in to 99%. This works on Dell, Acer, and probably other brands that run Intel CPUs.

If you're like me, who is forever cursed to have their laptops rendered only quasi-functional, you may have to go into your Registry Editor in order to make the option actually display. In RegEdit, go to “Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power"", and set CsEnabled to 0.

1683," Do not stop amputees or other visibly disabled people in the streets/in the wild, to ask them what caused their injury.","Even if you’re trying to thank them for their military service. 

As an amputee, I’ve had people follow me into my work to ask me what happened to my leg, tap me on the shoulder while I’m in line for the ATM, while I’m trying to order food, while sitting on a park bench reading. The list goes on. Many under the usual guise of “I thought you were in the military and wanted to thank you.”

No one owes you an explanation as to what happened to them, even if you think they’re in the military and want to thank them for that. If it’s obvious, if they’re wearing their military career on their sleeve so to speak, then maybe tactfully you can thank them, but otherwise, just leave people alone. 

To me it’s like continually being asked “what’s the worst thing that ever happened to you” when I’m just trying to live my life. I don’t owe you an explanation, and I certainly don’t owe your children an explanation, I am not your walking PSA. 

Some amputees don’t mind being asked, but after 29 years of being an amputee, I can tell you that many more are just over it. When I put my leg on, it’s just like putting on a pair of shoes, I don’t think about it again until I take it off, or if it’s bothering me, why are you here trying to remind me of it while I’m trying to go bowling with my family? 

If you’d like to educate your children about amputees, consider calling your local orthotics/prosthetics company and ask them about events they’re putting on or groups/meetings that you can attend to educate yourself and your children, but don’t ask that of strangers on the streets trying to get grocery’s.",LifeProTips,taliafromphilly,31,1,2020-07-09

Now, in 8 years of been licensed I had never gotten a single ticket and only got pulled over once when I was 17. But in the first several months of moving to my new city they’ve managed to send me two $100 tickets. So I decided to contest. I thought 11 mph over sounded high for me, so I thought it may be wrong. I contested the ticket online by writing a paragraph about how I know I was driving slower and that I requested they provide records of the last time their speed camera was calibrated. I submitted no evidence, never when to court. Just wrote a few sentences. 

Three months later I get message in the mail stating that based on my “statement and/or evidence and/or the government’s failure to meet its burden of proof” the ticket was dismissed. Boom, a hundred bucks saved. 

Keep in mind, this might not always work. A professor I had (who is a lawyer) tried this approach in court when his wife ran a red once. It took the state 6 months but they found the calibration records and she had to pay.

1714, Catch Someone Cheating Using Snapchat Hack,"I’m about to blast this everywhere. 

Before I caught my husband cheating I spent some time looking for someone on here to make a Snapchat account so they could flirt with him to see if he would respond. It never worked out because it’s dangerous to give out your personal account to a random stranger on the internet. Here’s how you can make a fake account yourself and catfish your SO with pictures from your camera roll. 

If you want to catch someone cheating on Snapchat I learned an amazing hack you can use. I used it recently and it works like a charm. 

1. Go to Snapchat and type into the search bar “camera roll”
2. There you will find a multitude of lenses that allow you to upload a photo from your camera roll but make it seem like you’re sending a regular snap photo in real time. It’s that easy. 

I would do a test run before you send it to your SO just to make sure it works. I tried it and sent it to myself first and it was not a blue chat and it didn’t say “sent from camera roll” or anything like that. It showed up on my Snapchat as a little red square that opened up like any normal snap would and disappeared once I opened it. 

You have to watch which lense you use because some of them give it away. For example, the first one I tried had a little star at the top, like a watermark so make sure you find one that doesn’t have that.

Edit: just want to clarify that I’ve been using this hack for the past few days to talk to one of the women he cheated on me with. I’m logged into his Snapchat account on my phone (he lost his social media privileges) and I’ve just had this feeling that he hasn’t been telling me the whole truth about what happened. I’ve been “snapping” her form his account, using selfies that he’s sent me to carry on a conversation with her to try and get information. She didn’t believe it was him at first until I used the lense to send her an actual snap photo but now she is completely convinced and let me tell you, the conversation has been real interesting.",LifeProTips,lbk84853,24,0,2020-07-08

Hope this message finds y’all well. I’m 31M single, working in tech and live in a rented apartment in Bay Area, financially stable but not at life. I have full time job and for the time being (COVID) I’m working from home. Lately I’ve been feeling quite lonely and not in happy/fun mood I used to be in. I’m smoking weed quit often and I don’t like it and want to stop ASAP. I felt I have time right now to take care of a pup and give my attention to it’s needs while this lockdown is in place. 

At the same time I also feel having a dog binds you in one place, not able to move as fast and quickly you could with out having one and your travel plans take a hit, and also comes the liability cost. I’m ready to take all the responsibility and pain that’ll take to raise a vizsla pup but is it worth my investment? 

I need your kind attention and honest advice on this matter. 

Your kindness,

1769," If you make a mistake at work, your boss should be the FIRST person to know!","This accomplishes three very important things.
 
- It lets them know that they can trust you to be honest.

- It lets them take action (or help you take action) immediately to fix the issue.

- It keeps them from looking stupid if someone else mentions it and they haven't heard it yet. You never want to make your boss look stupid .

This is key, especially if you are newer to the workforce. It's natural to want to try to hide your mistakes and fix them before anyone else knows. Sooner or later this will backfire on you and you'll come off MUCH worse than if you'd just owned up to it in the first place.

Plus, if you tell them, they can help you find ways to not make the mistake again.

In the current economic time I thought it might be good for folks to know there are some options for tapping retirement plans without the typical 10% penalty that makes it typically not advisable.  These are for provable Covid related loss of pay or expense items such as medical bills, loss of work, or childcare.  One thing to consider if this money is in the market is that money taken out now may be much less than it's future earning potential especially when the market is down.  If someone would like to link to a reputable source with more details it would be much appreciated.  I know myself that I just ignore my retirement savings because they are essentially untouchable but desperate times call for desperate measures and if you're fortunate enough to have retirement savings they may be an option in the current situation.

Y’all, about over a month ago, I noticed a few gaps growing between my teeth. Hadn’t worn my retainers consistently at all. I broke down to my dad crying about how my teeth were the only feature I like about myself and otherwise I feel very ugly. It was a bit pathetic, not going to lie. 

He told me to schedule an appointment with the ortho to see what they could do. Well, I went in today. There was definitely sanitation and social distancing in place, and masks were required, which is good (for you curious folk). Anyway, I went in and I got a humorous but brief scolding mitigated by terms of endearment. I think somehow they loosened one area to make it fit on my back teeth but then tightened near the middle to help counter the gaps.

They put the modified retainers in my mouth and pushed upwards. Y’all, those motherfuckers HURT. Felt like someone grabbed all my top teeth and squeezed them. I actually said “Ow.” I’m wearing them right now and my gums are throbbing and it feels like my teeth will fall out if I take them off.

1829, How to thru hike the Appalachian Trail at any fitness level,"First, ""the trail"" literally saved my life and I did not have a single bad day. It isn't an accomplishment, it is an honor. It is an amazing wonder we are incredibly lucky to experience. Before you say you can't,I've seen the legally blind, amputees, octagenarians all finish. Athletic types counterintuitively have a lower completion percentage than the introverted individuals not in particularly good shape. couch potatoes, smokers even. Because unlike a race, you come back to it every day so you have to leave some in the tank, never red-line yourself. Just walk, and eat and rest when your body wants to. It's learning not to push yourself, but hold yourself back

What worked for me was to forget about miles hiked in the beginning and just focus on time hiked. Hike 8 hours a day at whatever pace is comfortable. Take breaks when you need them, eat when hungry, take a zero days, sleep as late as your body seems to need. Don’t pick up the pace until comfortable hiking 8 hours. When you struggle, slow down and breathe

pretrain by getting your ankles,knees strong and lung function through deep breathing exercises. Don’t think about cardio or miles until you start. 

The trail is tough in Georgia &amp; Maine and the hiking is slow, so if you are focused on miles in the beginning, it will get into your head.

For most this puts you at 12-15 miles a day 3–4 weeks in and minimizes risk of injury. Focusing on miles pulls more off of the trail than anything else. You will get into shape without trying.

Cost was $3K for gear and food and lodging 6 months I had $1200 left after gear tent,cookware, stove, h20 purification, high end backback, good sleeping bag, good boots, good socks &amp; liners)

Women often do better late in the trail over men because they are much more efficient at metabolising fats and at the end they look great and the guys usually look like concentration camp survivors.  So you are the latter you must force the protein and calories at times to keep from hitting a wall nutritionally.  Oddly, you'll find that you can live on the densest of foods like sausages and little debbies and ""cameling up"" on periodic breakfast buffets and sweet trail town cuisine whenever you can is essential for many to maintain weight.  For many it will be one of the only times in their lives they will experience the feelings of fat deficiency.  Get the tuna in oil over water and use all of it with your dehydrated ramen. 

If  you have the opportunity to thru-hike, do it or accept that you are going to take a different path. That window doesn’t stay open long for most people so don't assume you have plenty of time later in life. Doing it changed everything for me. 

Good luck!  Please ask me any questions.

1843,"If you're an introvert or a shy teenager, don't EVER miss out a chance to socialize in school","I'm currently 18yo and this is my last year in high school, i was a total introvert and unsocial kid when i was still around 13yo, i would barely talk to anyone and i would talk with awkward skills when i had to talk with someone in school or outside in school, i had no friends and spend all day with my computer.

When i was 16yo, i had enough, the awkward phase had started, i knew i needed some social skills or i would spend my whole life with my awkward and cringe social skills, so this is what i did:-

-i was still an introvert and a shy person, but i would never be cold with anyone who tried to talk to me, i tried to be as friendly and helpful as possible whoever tried to start a conversation with me, it was awkward and cringe at first but i swallowed my shyness and did my best, and it actually worked, my classmates started to like me and was more friendly and interactive with me, note that I'm not cute or anything, I was hairy as fuck (still is) and my voice cracking was weird as hell, so if you're cute or something then you're fortunate, it will be even better.

-when people didn't wanted to start conversations with me, i swallowed my shyness again and would ask my classmates math questions or whatever related to school and i even knew the answer, but i wanted to make interactions to trigger out the situation, you're still respecting your introvertism like this.

-remember im still an introvert and paranoid teenager, even after i made friends i was still unsure and paranoid that they dont like me or dont want to hangout with me, so this is what i did: whenever i reached school it would take around 20 minutes before class starts, so every students are hanging out in the yard, i would go and try to find my friends and say hello to them so they know about my existince lol, then i would say im going to the cafeteria, most of times they would tag with me, and if they didn't i would just go and buy a drink then come back to the yard and patrol far but inside their sight, most of times they would call me to join them, i know this is a dick move but this is for my fellow paranoid teenagers out there.

-if you're good in school subject then try to help your classmates, when they're arguing over something just swallow your shyness and join them to help them, let them know you're a helpful fellow, and try to help them whenever they ask for help, that way they will start to like you and try to befriend you, but don't EVER help the bullies, not even if they force you, if they still insisted to force you give them your homework or something and you had no other choice then give them wrong homeworks or wrong answers.

This was my way, an ugly 16yo hairy introvert male, who spend his entire day with computer and video games to improve his social skills just in school, i'm still shit not gonna lie, but im %100 better than i was 2 years ago and im worshipping my 2-years-ago-self for that, I LOVE YOU MYSELF. 


TLDR: school is a gold mine for introvert teenagers, don't ever miss out a chance to be friendly with classmates and have a conversation , it will help you improve your social skills, even try to go out of your way and help your classmates or ask school-related questions to your classmates to interact with them and let them know you're not a wall, most of your classmates are friendless too, so be friendly with anyone and you'll be suprised of how many people will start befriend you.",LifeProTips,kurdish-devil,2,1,2020-07-08

1848,LPT : Give yourself weekly pocket money to help with budgeting and saving.,"Hi all

If like me you struggled at managing your money and have a habit of spending it as soon as it comes in on crap you don't need I have a few tips that have really helped me.

Firstly before you begin you are going to want to create a budgeting spreadsheet showing your income and outgoings. I have created one if you want to use mine [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18lGCfQerYXkrK1Djo-Ll9qvxhFM5uLCi/view?usp=drivesdk)

My copy of this budgeting spreadsheet has space for Income, additional income and outgoings which you would rename to things like rent, food ,different bills. I have input formulas to so it works out your total outgoings and what you have left each month. You don't have to use mine , excel has some templates for this or you can write it down , you just need to find something that works for you.

Secondly once you have your budget set up , decide how much realistically you could survive on a week and include that on the budget sheet. 

Id recommend getting a basic second bank card, it doesn't have to be a fancy one, I got a second card from my current bank, no overdraft no special features or nothing. 

Then from your main account set up a standing order to pay you weekly to your basic card your weekly spends for me this is £35 every Monday. 

At the end of each month, whatever you have left you can either transfer it back to your main account , which if you only stuck to using your basic card your main account should still have money in it or pop it into a savings account.

If you don't want to do the second card method you could always withdraw your weekly money but having a second card makes it so much easier, more automated and you don't have loose change lying around.

If you are going to try anything from this though I'd highly recommend you at least create or use my budgeting sheet, having an overview of what your money goes on is the first step to being able to save successfully .",LifeProTips,tollywollydooda,1,1,2020-07-08

Coffee, journaling, meditation
Drinking something is very good for our empty stomach. I like to drink coffee or sometimes green tea in the morning. It gives me a very refresh feeling.
While i wait my coffee to cool, i get my journal and write things that i am grateful for and set an intention for the day.
Step 2:
Work out
I don't do weightlifting or heavy exercise in the morning. My daily work out consists of long walks, stretching and few steps of yoga.
Step 3: 
Listen to a podcast/ audio books 
I prefer listen some motivational podcast which helps me alot in achieving my goals. I am a student so that's why my first priority listen to audio book.
Step 4: 
Reading
Reading is the exercise of our mind. I prefer reading in the morning or day time because when i read in night i fall asleep in just few minutes. I read books in the morning because i really enjoy long readings.

1877, Canes/Walking sticks as well as Salad Tongs and/or Ladles are very useful for SHORT PEOPLE and potentially for PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS,"I am 5'2"". I am short and I live in a world built for people taller than me. But I don't struggle and I don't need help because I have my secret weapons: my cane and my salad tongs and ladles. 

I'm a strong independent short woman and I don't need no man! (Or store clerk) 

I have issues with my feet and they can be quite painful, so I walk with a cane to take some of the pressure off them despite me being only 25 years old. But honestly, if I could take the pain away, I'd still walk with my cane because it's really handy! 

Uses of canes (other than how they are traditionally used): 

. Whacking things like cereal boxes down from high shelves in grocery stores. The handle can be useful to hook onto stuff to topple them over. No need to ask people to grab things for you anymore! 

. You can eventually master the art of picking things off the ground with the end of your cane. Usually stuff that's soft and can drape over the end like fabrics, or hooking bag handles. You can also (if particularly lazy and sitting in a chair and don't want to get up to pick something up from the floor) you can whack stuff closer to you or drag it over. 

. Pressing the door opening button before you even reach the doors so you never have to slow down your pace. I often think it'd be handy to have a stick for this purpose if I were in a wheelchair. Sometimes you can use the handle of the cane on certain door handles so you don't have to touch the door. Often I'll use my cane just to push doors open.

. Hooking onto tree branches to pull them down. (I like to press blossoms) 

. Self defense from muggers. 

. Looking classy. 

. Annoying people by poking them or knocking off their hats. 

Etc. 


The usefulness of ladles or salad tongs in the kitchen (other than the traditional uses): 

. Use the scoop of the ladle to grab onto the top of boxes (especially tea boxes) and pull them down from high shelves. 

. You can use the handle of the ladle to slide into the handle of mugs and carefully bring them down. 

. If you can't quite reach a cup or mug, you can use the ladle to inch it close enough for you to grab. 

. Tongs are perfect arm extensions to grab light stuff with. 



There you have it! Enjoy the wisdom of this short person!

I would avoid work and practice other activities that were more fun (such as gaming). I would lie to myself saying that I would do it later, but one month before an important test I decided that everyday I would study for one hour before I touched any type of entertainment. The first couple days were hell and I would just spend 80% of the time looking at the book and the other 20% actually learning. I saw that it was not going to work so I changed the one hour into achievements (like studying 20 pages and actually understanding them) and I would not touch any type of entertainment until I was done.

Long story short, with time I was able to get used to it and when I received the test results the hard work was rewarded. 
From then on I have been following this system strictly and got used to it. Even though I don't study one hour everyday I always complete the daily quota of studying because my productivity went up by a lot.

1945, To find right life partner – try to “justify” negative traits of your father or understand the positive sides of your father’s negative traits (for women).,"Psychology says that woman getting married with man who has some similarity with her father **if she respects him**. It's just easier for her to adjust to someone who’s behavior in family relationships easy to understand. That’s why we tend to repeat our parent’s relationship style and mistakes too.

If woman has some **negative feelings towards her father** it gives additional obstacles to meet the right partner.

WHAT TO DO?

1. In this situation one need to “justify” negative traits of her father or understand the positive sides of father’s negative traits.

Example: 

\- Physical abusive father – strong masculine energy, power

\- Too strict – organized, strives to keep all in order

\- Controlling father – takes care, not indifferent

\- Rude - strong masculine energy, truthfulness 

\- Doesn’t consider your opinion – takes full responsibility for the situation 

\- Avoider or indifferent – respects your boundaries and gives freedom

\- Doesn't keep promises – sees your ability to forgive and unconditional love

\- Insult – tries to be honest

\- Irresponsible – gives freedom, supports your independence

2. Once you will write down all positive sides of your father's negative traits – try to find these positive traits in yourself - you actually unconsciously adopted few of them from your dad, thank him and try to look closer to men with these positive qualities - you will definitely be pleased with the most positive version of your father. This exercise will also help to remove negative charge between you and your father. Similar way works for a man + his mother.

2. When you invite others, you invite other couples (to dinner dates, for instance). 
3. You don't want your friend to feel like a third wheel.

Bonus LPT: If you're only hanging out for a few hours and your friend struggles with the idea of being single do two things:

Their first impression about you might be associated with that boring work conversation they had with you.

(Hopefully, you’re never in a situation that needs to be filmed.)

By default, iPhone videos are shot at 30 fps (frames per second). When shooting in Slo-Mo on the iPhone, you can record at 120 or 240 fps. It produces a MUCH higher quality, more detailed, and smoother shot when slowed down.

You can apply slo-mo to the part that needs it. If you end up not needing slo-mo, you don’t need to apply it. All of this can be done without compromising the footage and audio.",LifeProTips,aznbbgirl,4,1,2020-07-07

1986, Don’t be swayed by “accident forgiveness” when buying car insurance,"Insurers have cleverly structured their pricing in ways that sound nice, but don’t really save you money.

The first of these is with “safe driver discounts” - this basically allows them to set the premium higher than they otherwise would, and then frame it as charity to you when they revert to charging you a fair amount via the discounts.

So if you have a policy with accident forgiveness, you’re potentially already paying an elevated amount before you get into an accident - your underlying premium may not go up because it was already high to begin with.

Plus, then they can justify taking away your “safe driver discount” - they aren’t raising your rates due to an accident, just ceasing to offer you the “discount” that brought them to a fair price in the first place.

So in essence, be weary of these terms and crunch the numbers on what you’ll actually be paying rather than overvaluing benefits like this in name alone.",LifeProTips,feliscumpleanos,5,1,2020-07-07

I don't know if/how well this will work for people with actual insomnia, but it helps me every time I'm having trouble turning off my brain and going to sleep.  It's something I adapted from learning to meditate in yoga class. 

First, I get comfy and close my eyes. I start with my toes, focusing on them and thinking to myself how relaxed my toes are. Then my feet, my ankles, and so on working my way up the body, with the head being last.  Take a few seconds on each part to really feel it relax before moving on. 
(My internal monologue is usually something along the lines of ""relax your toes... let your toes relax... feel how relaxed your toes are.  Let your feet relax..."")
If my mind starts to try to think about something else, I don't get mad at myself, just recognize the distraction and imagine the thought floating away. Then get back to relaxing your body.

1998," If you see someone on the side of the highway with the emergency lights blinking, do not go and help yourself. Call the police.","This might need some clarification. At least where I live, everyone is obliged to help by law if you see an accident. If I see a car on the side of the road with their emergency lights on, I always call 112 (european equivalent of 911). My wife hates this, but it is the right thing to do. They might have just ran out of gas, have car trouble, or someone might be dying. You never know. But I always think ”It could’ve been me.”

NOTE: if it is an abandoned car, do NOT call the police. There is no emergency there. Abandoned cars are usually turned off, there is no people around and they even might’ve been looted / broken into at this point. 

So if you see the accident happen yourself, and you can safely go and help, then go and help yourself to best of your ability AND also call your local emergency number is. BUT in most cases calling the emergency number is the best way you can help.

If you are driving at highway speeds on a busy highway, you usually only have a few seconds to see the accident site. But trying to help means you need to stop your car, which is illegal in many places, because by hitting the brakes at highway speeds to full stop you can cause even larger pile-up accident. So don’t do that, because we don’t want more casualities.

So if you see a car on the side of the road (or some other dangerous situation), do not hesitate to call the emergency number and tell them:

- your name 
- what road you are on and which direction you are heading (eg. ”E18 heading East”)
- what happened
- the location to the best of your ability, either the previous or next exit or if you see a sign that says the distance to the next town usually helps
- the color of the car (and type / brand / model of the car if you know)
- did you see any people 

Another LPT: calling 911 or 112 doesn’t cost anything and you can call it even if you ran out of calling credits or even from a phone without a sim card.",LifeProTips,ahjteam,9,2,2020-07-07
1999, how to stop yourself from thinking and acting irrationally in a relationship,"This is gonna be a bit niche but please bear with me. My friend was experiencing a lot of insecurity in her relationship, which was causing irrational urges to be controlling and possessive over her boyfriend. She explained that the way she was able to combat this insecurity was to make up a narrative in her mind about his “ex”. 

She actually didn’t know anything about his real ex. But the story in her head is that his ex would demand to know where he was at all times, assume he was out cheating, control him financially, and do any other negative thing that she was trying to work on. 

That meant that she had a strawperson who she could feel superior to every time she needed to rationalise: “Of course he isn’t out cheating. I trust him, unlike his ex did.” 
“I shouldn’t make him come home by 11. That’s too controlling. It’s something his ex would do.” 

Psychologically, the desire to “be the best he’s had” counter-balanced the insecurity she felt in the relationship, allowing her to think and act more rationally.",LifeProTips,-_Rin,8,1,2020-07-07

2002," Instead of having all the dust fall onto the floor, use an old pillow case to help with cleaning your ceiling fan.","The longer the ceiling fan runs, the more dust that collects on it. It is vital to clean ceiling fans once a week, otherwise there will be clumps of dirt flung through the air every time you turn the fan on. If that sounds gross, there are a slew of dust mite-induced health risks that come from a dirty fan. This is hazardous for those who suffer from allergies and some people also experience skin reactions when exposed to dirt.

One of the easiest ways to clean the fan is with a pillow case. Slip the pillow case over the fan and then clean the top, bottom and sides of the fan gently ensuring the dust is collected inside of the pillow case. It’s recommended to wipe the motor and pull chain with a clean cloth, but use a dry microfiber cloth on the light bulb.

Dusting the ceiling fan once a week will save you the trouble of massive accumulation of dust later. This is one of those household chores that’s easy to ignore and even easier to forget, but your health and ceiling fan performance actually depend on it.",LifeProTips,MindyS1719,5,2,2020-07-07

Often, it can be really hard to navigate difficult life situations (someone passing away, losing a job, an abusive relationship, a scary medical situation, etc) and feeling like it should have to be ok when there is no possible way to do so can really add a lot of pressure.

A helpful way to approach that situation might be something like...” I’m sorry to hear that, I’m here for you if you want to talk about it more or have a shoulder to lean on through this” if that seems too personal or not appropriate, even something like “ ok, thanks for letting me know, if anything changes, I would still love for you to join!” Even a “no pressure but I’m here if you want to talk” is great, as long as you don’t expect them to reach out.

Especially people that are considered smart early on and don't have to do much in school, often have huge problems later in life, because they haven't learnt how to learn. 
So I want to share a piece of advice that saved me from falling into that trap but what I consider to be important for everyone:

After you learnt *how* to do it. Learn and practice how to do it fast/with less thinking about it.

Finding shortcuts gives you a far deeper understanding. 
Applying the recently acquired knowledge to different example situations, saves you a lot of time in stressful situations and helps remember it for a longer time. 
Just because you understood doesn't mean you are already finished. 
To all people thinking ""i don't have to study for that test, i understood what the teacher taught"". Maybe yes. But try to get your mind used to figuring out more complex stuff. Try to find interconnections everywhere until you have understood far more than you need to for that exam. - with this understanding comes efficiency.
And practicing to be fast with a method often feels like learning to your brain and it gets used to being used in that way.

(I know i didn't got that in a clear explanationpath but  I hope you can take something positive from it nevertheless)

2241, How to get seriously considered when applying for apartments,"I'm a landlord and there a few things I look for in applications and any of these points increase a potential tenant's chances significantly. Now this mostly applies to private tenants since big corp's won't give a damn who you are because they will just require ridiculous down payments and easily chase you to court for the rest.

1. Tell them you value their property and understand the trust of lending it to you.
2. If you either are or know someone who is handy, tell them that if you by accident damage the property you will personally fix it or get it fixed. If you don't know how, you will tell them immediately so they can help you get it fixed instead of it becoming a large damage.
3. Offer them to come to your current address to sign the form (obviously make sure your current residence is clean and presentable).
4. Tell them you're never late on rent and if for whatever reason you should be, you will explain to them why and how you intend on remedying it right away (you would be surprised by the amount of headache landlords have because of tenants just flat out ignoring their rent and then turning off their phones).
5. Tell them you respect your neighbors and make sure to keep the community friendly.

I'm surprised how few applications actually list these obvious points of pain for us landlords. We are scared that:

1. You won't pay on time or at all.
2. You will trash our property.
3. You will be chased off by neighbor complaints.

Reallocate that restaurant's votes to the other two restaurants based on the second place votes. Whichever restaurant now has a majority of the votes is the winner.  
  
With three options this process is extremely simple, but it will work with any number of choices, and any number of voters.

If a friend has troubles and you recommend them therapy, go the extra mile and offer to walk with them to their appointment, wait outside, and walk them home.

Imo offering this can make a huge difference because for some, going to therapy might be scary, feel emasculating/shameful, or lonely. Its likely to feel empty and exhausted after a session and having company afterwards can snap one back into reality.

2398, Practice small talk,"New situations can be challenging- especially at work. If you have social anxiety or want to work on small talk this LPT is for you.

Have at least three questions and three answers/stories practiced for new situations. Practice them with your friends. Throw a small story out in conversation to see the reaction. Did people smile? File it away for small talk. Were people confused? Try a different tactic. Use these stories over and over. Gauge people's reactions each time.  Practice your small talk intros. I'll often practice how I introduce myself. You'll get better at this over time and be able to improv. 

For example- (I cant give real examples so I hope this gets the gist)

New job - How's your day today? Funny story, I was walking into my interview for this job once and the hiring manager was wearing the same top! Do we have a uniform or something, if I have to match every day it's going to be tough! (Yes doing small talk involves making bad jokes). 

In October- Halloween always gets me excited. Do you have any plans? Last year I got to see this really cool performer! (Alternatively, I had this terrible costume once) 

Coworkers at bar - so what do yall drink here? Once I was at a work party and they served xyz. 

And more! Have a couple bad puns or dad jokes.

The key is to practice small stories you can plug and play in conversations. That way you're in your comfort zone and have less risk of upsetting someone!",LifeProTips,bikeroni,11,2,2020-07-04

If you're like me, you feel overwhelmed with the amount of entertainment you wish to consume. The world provides so much - how can I ever experience the best of it?

So I started by speeding up my podcasts. I NEVER had time to keep up with all the podcasts I wanted to listen to. I started with 1.25 speed, which cut down the time significantly. I acclimated to this and now I can listen to podcasts at 1.5 speed. If I hear a podcast at regular speed, I am SHOCKED at how much it drraaaggggsssss on. Now I can manage to listen to every episode of the podcasts I want to keep up with.

So I took this strategy to YouTube and audiobooks. Now I can keep up with all my favorite YouTubers, and catch up on my reading list. I wish that I could do this for television, but I've yet to figure that out.

Like I said - not for everyone. I can understand feeling like you're missing out on the present moment, or not fully enjoying. I felt this way at first, but like I said, give it time, and you will be able to keep up no problem. I am so overjoyed at how much media I can now consume!",LifeProTips,RealHousevibes,4,5,2020-07-04

How absurdly self important to presume that you are more capable of choosing how to live someone's life than they are themselves. Of course everyone else's problems seem simple to you, you don't have even a fraction of the context. Your problems seem stupidly simple to them as well.

**3.** Was the second World War really necessary?

And because he's an idiot, when he gets scared, he growls and nips and starts a fight.

This happens over and over.

Since then I really interrogate them in my interview. When you do this the interviewers should - if they’re any good - will really appreciate it, be impressed and  recognise it as a strength.

This is because small things are harder to find amongst bigger things.  


Here are some situations where I've found sorting by size really useful:

* Packing a rucksack with several pockets. I put small things (e.g. keys, chewing gum, inhaler, hand sanitizer) all in one pocket, medium sized things (e.g. wallet, phone, gloves, retainer) distributed among the other pockets, and larger things (e.g. jacket, trainers) in the main section.
* Moving kitchen items into a new kitchen. I put small cutlery and small spice jars all in the same draw, cans and packets/bottles of a similar size in a new cupboard (or several cupboards), then it gets more complicated because you have pans, plates, glasses, bags of veg, a bottle of olive oil etc, but I think baring the size rule in mind is still useful for this bit.

2614, Check to see if you can get a free library card from other counties and cities in your state,"I feel like every couple of weeks, I see someone praising Libby and OverDrive — which is fine because they’re great apps/services. But inevitably, someone will comment about how their library doesn’t have a large ebook selection or the wait for holds is endless.

The best solution for this is to check other counties and cities in your state and see if you can get a free library card from them. Sometimes libraries will let you get a card if you’re a resident of the state. Often, libraries will allow you to get a card if you live in a neighboring county. Even more often, they’ll let you get a card if you work in that county. (And they’ll definitely let you get a card if you own property or pay property tax in that county, though that’s probably less common.)

#Check Neighboring Counties

So a good first start is to check your neighboring counties or even just the largest city/county near you. Check their website to see if you can get a card.

**Once again, if you work in another county/city/state, you can likely get a library card there.**

#Check Local Cities

Next, check to see it you can double up on a city and county card. If you live in an unincorporated part of a county, you likely have a county library card. But you’re also likely able to get a card from a city that has its own library system within that same county (and vice-versa). Sometimes these smaller, city libraries are part of a larger collective (like Northeastern [State Name] Library Association); that group of libraries will have its own ebook catalogue, etc.

#Check Statewide

If that doesn’t work (or even if it does), expand your scope. Double-check on the countywide and citywide level. Just today, I found I couldn’t get a library card for a library two counties over — but there was a city library within it whose only requirement was that I reside in the state. I got a card instantly!

#Check Where You Were Born

This hasn’t come up in my research often (only once), but some libraries will provide you a free library card if you were born in that city/county regardless of where you currently reside. That’s not a bad deal.

#Check Their COVID-19 Rules

From my anecdotal research, some libraries are relaxing their rules a bit and giving out up to 90-day temporary cards if you provide a state address, especially if you normally would have to go in-person to get a card. When researching libraries in your state, see if this is an option. It is usually announced with a banner on the homepage, etc., as it’s not normally how they do business.

#Make the Most of Your Cards

Most libraries have access to OverDrive and Libby. On the Libby app, you can easily switch cards to see if a book that is unavailable in your local library is available elsewhere. It’s a breeze.

Some libraries use Hoopla too, which is different from Libby/OverDrive. There are no holds on Hoopla. If you want something (ebooks, audiobooks, movies, music, TV shows), you get it instantly. In my experience, the catalogue isn’t as big as OverDrive, but this is an important note, especially for people who don’t like to wait.

See what other online resources they have. A neighboring county I have a card to provides access to Kanopy, which is a movie streaming service that’s a bit more intuitive than Hoopla. Some offer magazines, newspapers, other music services, etc.

Add the [Library Extension](https://www.libraryextension.com/) to your browser. You can use Amazon/Goodreads to search books and the extension will tell you if it’s in any of your libraries’ catalogues. This is helpful to (A) get you to not spend money if you don’t want to but (B) because those sites’ UIs can often be more intuitive than libraries’.

#Borrow Someone’s Card

And last but not least: You can also always ask someone living somewhere else to let you borrow their card. If someone you know works in a different county/city, that works too. Both of your loans will show up in the same Libby shelf, which can be annoying and I hate it. But it’s an option. Some libraries are totally cool with this. They literally state anyone can use your card, but you’re responsible for return/fees (which won’t happen with ebooks since they’re returned automatically). Some… aren’t. I am not officially condoning you do this for libraries that aren’t cool with it. Not officially.

Quarantining can be not-so-fun, and many of us don’t have extra funds to lessen it, so make use of the free resources available to you! It’s more than books. It’s music, movies, TV shows, news, magazine articles, and more. Hope this helps.",LifeProTips,WouldItNot,5,2,2020-07-03

Almost all of us have an immediate subconscious notion that they're laughing at us causing us to further fumble or mess things up more.

Instead, you can pause, breathe and look at this from their perspective. It might surely look funny. So the joke is the situation and not YOU. Face it, something funny did happen. So own it and again, breathe or sigh!

However...if your credit card company allows you to move your statement issue date, wait until a week or so before your statement is issued and ask them to move it to a week ago. As they can't retrospectively issue the statement, it'll get pushed off until the following month. Your minimum payment can't be due until after the statement is issued and so you get another month. 

You can actually do the same thing next month and keep shifting the date back, theoretically indefinitely. At the company I worked for, it was entirely within the rules - to the extent that when a rep refused to do this for someone that had done this for four months in a row without making a single payment and I refused on the escalated call because of the obvious exploit, I eventually overturned by our complaints team because they couldn't identify anything in the T&amp;Cs that prevented it.

Few notes of caution - you can't do this after the statement is issued and you'll still incur interest if you have a balance from the previous months statement. But it definitely works.",UnethicalLifeProTips,fuckusnowman,0,1,2020-07-11

To make this easier, open a sticky note or notepad window and drag it to the top of your screen, directly underneath your webcam. This works best if you are using a laptop webcam, as the quality is not too high and the camera will be positioned right above your screen. Write a script for your presentation and paste it into the notepad window. Then, while you give your presentation, you can read from this script and it will appear that you are just looking at the webcam.

2732, How to live as an illegal immigrant in England if you have no way of attaining legal citizenship,"For any fellow working class people like myself with few marketable skills and who are interested in an adventure and willing to work, befriending Irish Travelers is a great way to stay in England for an extended period of time undocumented.

Some background: 

In England there's an ethnic group known as Irish Travelers, commonly referred to as ""gypsies"" by the English. Many Travelers really hate being called gypsies and see it as a derogatory term. Many Travelers live as nomads and will set up caravan camps on unused/undeveloped land, often on the edge of farm fields where they squat for 30 days before they can be lawfully removed and they move on to a new site, some communities of travelers aren't as mindful as others about leaving no trace, and they can tear up the fields and leave trash piles which is one reason why they are despised. Not all communities of Travelers are nomadic and many have established communities on the outskirts of many English towns. 

You have to realize that the Traveler way of life is centuries old and dates back before private property was really a thing, and also is the result of centuries of discrimination which kept these people in poverty and from owning land.

The Magna Carta (the document that the US constitution was based on, and all modern democracies were influenced by) in particular the Charter of the Forest, guaranteed and protected the rights of the peasants to have unfettered access to the land so that they could use natural resources to sustain themselves. This is in part the origin of Traveler culture in England.

Travelers make their living doing various odd jobs, roofing, landscaping, painting, scrapping, construction, demolition, etc, with a smattering of various illegal activities thrown in; cock fighting and unsanctioned boxing matches for example. The Irish Travelers are a tight knit community and look out for each other and if you prove yourself to them most will extend that generosity to you and help you out with most anything you need.

I spent a good amount of time around Irish Travelers in England, the majority are good people. Unfortunately most English citizens conveniently overlook the daily harassment, systemic, and institutional discrimination and oppression the Traveler community faces and how that feeds into their own suspicions and contempt towards outsiders. A good place to look for a Traveler community to integrate into would be at a pub frequented by Travelers or on the outskirts of a small to mid size town. Travelers tend to live on the outside and more isolated parts of towns and cities because it's easier for them to avoid being harassed and to stay out of the eye of the law. 

Many Travelers unfortunately fall into the vices of poverty and often run afoul of the law which is how they have earned a negative reputation. I think it's bullshit how Travelers are treated and I've seen how their treatment by the English marginalizes them and makes ethnic tensions worse. 

Many Irish Travelers are wary of strangers and are rough around the edges, but they're cool with Americans and other outsiders. Just have a good sense of humor, don't take yourself too seriously, and have a thick skin and you'll fit right in. I worked with some Irish Travelers for a few days while I was in England for 6 months because I was bored, the work is hard but you won't be working insane hours, generally around 6-10 most days. 

Most Irish Travelers pride themselves on putting in a full day of work, they see the rest of the English as lazy, and after having worked with Travelers I will never doubt the Traveler work ethic, but as a working class American who has worked 10-12 hour days 6-7 days a week doing manual labor they still don't work as hard as we do, ha. But I much prefer the Traveler way of life because they live as they please and don't answer to anyone.",UnethicalLifeProTips,Eminent_Assault,10,1,2020-07-12

Once you’re positive the water temperature is good, take a sip of the hot water and groggily trudge up to your mom/dad.

2777, I feel bad even sharing this," 

Before I begin, I did not use this in an unethical way, but it did open my eyes to the massive possibility of abuse.

I moved a month ago and in the move my flatscreen television was broken. I love television as much as anyone and ordered a replacement off Amazon. For the sake of accuracy and the potential for replication of this unethical tip, the tv was on the higher price side ($2k). After 2 weeks of waiting and meeting a freight delivery guy at my building I was finally back in action.

About 30 days into ownership I noticed the back light of the television was sometimes staying on after power down. I actually noticed in the morning so it was literally staying on all night. I thought it a fluke, but then it continued to happen. The solve was rather simple, just power the tv on and off again. No biggie. I went online to see if others with the television had experienced this issue. Low and behold it wasn't super uncommon. There was even a guy who had the tv replaced by the same model which also had the same back light issue. Many thought a future firmware update would fix it, but after spending money I figured I should consider replacing it.

I reached out to the amazon seller and they asked for a picture/video of the issue and the serial number off the television. I have no doubt based on their response that this was a known problem and their solution was

1. to offer to arrange for pickup, a return and full refund of the television or
2. take a $400 credit to keep the television.

Choice 2 also mentioned that if I ever desired to revert to step 1. that I could do so within the warranty period provided by amazon and would still have access to the extended warranty through the manufacturer. This was a no brainer and in my eyes excellent customer service. Now you may be asking? Where's the unethical tip? See below:

TL:DR Order an expensive television off of Amazon (if you need one). Look up common defects in that model. Find a picture online that shows the issue. Get free money in the form of a partial refund to just keep the TV (I got $400). Sellers would prefer this vs. taking back a broken television on top of the lost freight cost.",UnethicalLifeProTips,akopley,10,1,2020-07-13

2945,ULPT take advantage of large corporations greed,"     When entering a large scale business be aware of your surroundings. What do you see, if the answer is money you are on the right track. So here’s what you want to do. Follow these steps and you will be walking away with cash in your pocket and a smile on your face. You must be asking can I get caught?! This is what I will explain. So here is the basic premise of this master mind of a plan I got going for you fine folks. 
       Let me explain why this works and why large corporations. When our founding fathers discovered and built our country the principles and idea of human condition was fully developed and a large mobility was developed and thoroughly performed. Large corporations do not change the importance of what the people need in a proper and disgusting form of what we think and what the people properly need.
     The meat and big portion of this plan is the mindset that is required and devotion to perform what is known as this method and metrology which can be actively criticized and counted as an alleviation of the truth. Let me explain what we have here is something that many people can use on a daily basis and benefit from. And what do the people need the most? Money! This method developed from the mind of the people can help develop and form what is known as success in life and happiness.
      On to the safety and concern of this plan. To answer the question of is this safe? The answer is simply this, if you do not wish to be caught than why choose to try and why choose to perform and develop the mind further in an active pursuit of the truth or what this method may cause. The outcome is not what matters but what is physically manifested to be in our pockets thoroughly and possibly the wallet. But then safety and trust which the human mind can perceive is quite remarkable as to which the consequences may flow through several perhaps databases or processed through a unique synchronization.
     Alright if you stuck through to this part here is where the reward will certainly show. But first let me explain the reward system and how we can accomplish these seemingly menial tasks for the one goal. Large corporations do not care about the wellbeing of a daily basis but certainly outcomes and inputs. To factor it down here is where we currently stand on a trivial scale. Medium to mismatched height advantages can be the cause of corporate greed and which the local populace can take advantage of.
   If you have any questions please leave a comment, I have used this trick several times.
  One corporation is recorded stating “ It was a rat's nest. Not a literal one, but that is what her hair seemed to resemble every morning when she got up. It was going to take at least an hour to get it under control and she was sick and tired of it. She peered into the mirror and wondered if it was worth it. It wasn't. She opened the drawer and picked up the hair clippers. “
  The main person behind this method actually said in his own words, Josh had spent year and year accumulating the information. He knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field, Josh would be the one to call. The problem was that there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it. Years of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic. So what we can perceive here is basically He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what made the choice so difficult. What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. This would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn't.
    To conclude this long method Spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure, but this wasn't the type of excitement she was hoping to experience. As she contemplated the situation she found herself in, she knew she'd gotten herself in a little more than she bargained for. It wasn't often that she found herself in a tree staring down at a pack of wolves that were looking to make her their next meal.
  For final touches to make this method perfection I inadvertently went to See's Candy last week (I was in the mall looking for phone repair), and as it turns out, See's Candy now charges a dollar -- a full dollar -- for even the simplest of their wee confection offerings. I bought two chocolate lollipops and two chocolate-caramel-almond things. The total cost was four-something. I mean, the candies were tasty and all, but let's be real: A Snickers bar is fifty cents. After this dollar-per-candy revelation, I may not find myself wandering dreamily back into a See's Candy any time soon.

2952,UPLT: How to fool the TSA,"All credit goes to garynuman9

Actually want to avoid TSA bullshit and never have your luggage lost ~and~ be able to fly with reasonably well concealed edibles or concentrates?

Fly with a gun in your checked bag.

Seriously.

It's a simple form you have to fill out, totally legal &amp; normal. Just let them know you need the appropriate form to declare a firearm at the check in counter.

You fill it out, go to an area where your bag is searched by hand by TSA in front on you, you lock it, it's never opened again after that point.

Pro's of this approach.

you are required by federal law to use a NON TSA lock &amp; a hard case. The only time your checked luggage can be opened is in your presence. You are the only one with the key.

no fears of lost luggage or theft. Losing a gun is a LOT of paperwork for an airline.

you are the only one with a key to your bag

the TSA agents who do these searches are vets not newbies. They are looking for dangerous and illegal to fly with shit. Pack your thc vape carts with some regular vape kit in with your toiletries. They literally don't have the time to give a shit &amp; are far more likely to question the damn batteries.

flare guns count as firearms per federal law. Cheap marine ones can be had for $50. Super good locks can be bought for $50-$100.

literally never worry about flying with personal quantities of anything that isn't flower again, along with having a far more pleasant screening experience, next to no chance of having things stolen from your bag, and a much greater chance of never having to deal with the hell that is a lost bag.

I don't own a gun nor do I feel the desire or need to.

I do have a second hand starter pistol bought for next to nothing simply to make flying slightly less awful.

Money well fucking spent.

Edit:

For the trust, but verify crowd...

/u/zer0cul 's reply links the video that first informed me of this. If interested I suggest watching it, the link to a fuller set of sources/tips/regulations is in the video description.

TSA regulations(https://www.tsa.gov/travel/transporting-firearms-and-ammunition)

As to flying internationally. It's easier than you would expect even to countries with stricter gun laws. You need to check the regulations on the state department's website of the country that you are traveling to for their rules - all vary and there is no tldr, suprisingly few countries prevent temporary importation if you intend to return with it and travel with no ammo... and the US Customs &amp; Border Control website if you're an insane person who wants to travel with more than 3 firearms or more than 1000 rounds of ammunition.

Also I misspoke - they only search your bag if it fails a swab or other basic clearance test. If unlike me you don't smoke a lot at home to the point where your baggage may pop you won't even be subjected to the hand search. TSA marks the tag clear. It's never opened until you retake possession of it at your destination.",UnethicalLifeProTips,mark4562,1,1,2020-06-29

1) If you have a pc, you can most likely sell your unused computing power. I use a combo of OUGO Browser and LoadTeam. Google them to know more about how they work – one is basically a referral browser and the other is a passive app that uses your cpu power. Between the two of them I make around £1.60 a day, which doesn’t sound like much but it’s a free Deliveroo every week, or your spotify / Netflix / prime paid… without having to move a single finger.

2) The “big” bucks comes from cryptocurrency mining. This is something that is never recommended for a reason, it is not profitable against the price of electricity. However, if you have the time and knowledge to set this up in an office space where the electricity is free… this is a real possibility.

I have hidden in my bottom drawer 3 Antminer I bought 6 months ago, on the used market, for a fraction of the price. The guy was selling them after realizing he made a loss. They profit me around £8.70 a day, which is basically the hourly minimum wage, but it’s also £261 a month, or in 5 month it’s £1300 which the price of an expensive PC for gaming or top graphic card… for free!

I would have bought more of those miners but I have only three plugs I can use without people thinking I am doing more than charging my phone and devices. Plus, those machines heats like radiators so you want to give them proper spacing.

I set them up in my bottom drawer, and I undid the cover on the back of the drawers to give them proper ventilation.

So to recap, between the two I am able to net around £10/day, or £300/month. Not bad but it requires an initial investment of time and some money.

I have been doing this for 8 months and so far no one ever noticed anything. People even used my desk and didn’t see/noticed anything.",UnethicalLifeProTips,LargePizzaAndBeer,2,1,2020-06-15

Afterwards tie the bag and drop it inside so it'll be fully hidden inside the carton, then pour back it's original drink again.

Now you have a convincing looking bottle that when tested is still a plain simple drink.

All you need to do is empty the bottle and cut it to expose the bag with your favorite beverage.

\*You need to make it believable the amount that's being poured (of the original drink) is really all there is, otherwise with too little of the original drink it'd raise suspicion that the bottle is too heavy.

Apply to every major and local news station. Accept the job for the best one you can get. It does not matter if you are a news reporter, just so long as you have access to the set. Spend years working your way up, eventually with your many years of news experience you can apply to FOX, CNN, MSNBC or some other national news station. 

Now that you have been hired at a national news station it is time to strike. For your whole life you have been a sleeper agent waiting for your moment. 

Find the drinking cooler and fill it will sleeping medicine and roofies. Go in the fridge where everyone’s food is and sprinkle roofies on their food. By lunch time most of the station should be passed out. 

Run onto the live news set and just go crazy. Say whatever you want. Say the n-word, curse scream, break things, just spas the fuck out. Get naked and shit on the floor. Cover yourself in horse radish and eat the shit on live TV.

Saying things like  ""German nationals are the only true white people. Brown hair and brown  eyes are worse than brown skin. The reason Hitler was unsuccessful was  because he had brown hair and wasn't truly Aryan. Anyone under 6ft isn't  truly white.""

She is doing much better and is motivated to get up, research, and watch financial news. However, she hasn't been able to invite anyone to the app, which gets her and the new user a share of a random stock. This put a limit on what she can do since I didn't have much to give her :(

I hope this isn't violating any rules, but in anyone thought about playing the market as the world economy and market return, could you help by using this link to get her a free share? 

I'm sorry to have to ask, but I would do anything for my wife, and these last few months have been very hard.

Even if you can't because you already have the app or don't play the stock market, feel free to share this. Thank you for taking the time to read this! I hope everyone is doing well, staying safe, healthy, and sane during these crazy times!

4) Once you’ve got your coffee, email the coffee company and tell them the grind size is wrong.

3332, Make your own riot friendly non-lethal rounds with empty paint balls.,"You can buy empty paint balls and fill them with whatever you want like pepper spray or non lethal explosives like in the link below. You can also fill them with lighter fluid and pair the ammo with a round that can ignite the flames. This allows you to set fire to buildings (or people) from 80-100 feet away. A paint ball pistol is easily concealed, inexpensive, and easy to ditch if needed. Paint can also be used to coat tactical helmet visors as suggested in previous posts. If you want to get truly dark on a violent cop you can fill them with hydrofluoric acid. Hydroflouric acid pellets can also be used to melt locks. But beware the splash.

Before anyone criticizes me for these suggestions realize there are officers out there who are killing us. We didn't declare war, it was declared on us.

3370, How to exploit the poor for money,"American and British cigarette manufacturers have been selling single cigarettes to children in third world countries and also distributing them free to very young poor children in order to set establish junior dealer networks rather similar to the methods used by illicit drugs dealers. You can go to poor countries and sell cigarettes after getting them hooked. 

Corporations in both countries (and many others) exploit child labor overseas in manufacturing industries (clothing for example). You can invest in any company that does this. For an example, you could buy shares of Apple. 

Cigarettes are generally promoted to poor peoples because they may be more receptive to the aspirational images promoted by excessive advertising by very rich corporations. You can buy shares in both the cigarette manufacturers and their contracted advertising agencies.

Junk food is promoted to poorer people in the west because it is cheap, if lacking nutrition, some people have suggested that low vitamin high fat/high sugar food is addictive and looking at the shape of poorer westerners I’m inclined to agree.

Buy shares in junk food restaurants, Warren Buffet has been doing this for years.

Poor people are exploited financially as a result of extraordinarily high rates of interest which they are charged on loan agreements, in particular, consumer credit.

Credit card companies will purport that the exorbitant high interest rates represent a risk premium, it is the de facto poor person’s premium.

The very wealthiest get to accumulate assets at a rate of interest close to zero %, they get to borrow almost free money, then buy leveraged assets to greatly increase returns.

The poor don’t get leveraged returns, only liabilities.

Consumer credit is marketed at poor people in order to make spending appear easy, to make them momentarily feel richer, however, credit cards serve to make them poorer of course and usually forever in debt, they become hooked, rather like the victims of the cigarette manufacturers and fast food joints, you see the common theme here?…………dependancy.

Buy shares in the banks and finance companies that issue credit cards at the highest rates to the poorest in society.

The poor become addicted or dependant before they can work out just what is happening to them. Most of them are not taught this in school so they are ripe for exploitation. So get poor people hooked on drugs then sell to them!

Lottery companies sell dreams of extreme wealth for a $ dollar, cigarette manufacturers sell images of sex appeal or success, fast food restauranteurs are selling happiness in family groups filling their stomachs with dirt cheap food. Again, buy shares in all those companies and resell lottery tickets.

The poor want what they can’t have. The rich are happy to sell them dreams of what poor people think it is that will make them feel rich. This is what you want to exploit, get creative!

To continue the theme, you could open a church or mosque, poor people are exploited further in paying for their spiritual dependancy, at great cost over their lifetimes, keeping them ever poorer, even less in control of their wretched lives as a result.

If you can’t be bothered with any of this, the lazy way to exploit the poor is to simply vote Republican.

If you can’t bring yourself to vote Republican then give your vote to the Democrats, the tune is different but the net result is the same, the poor are exploited, the poor get ever poorer and income inequality widens exponentially.

Exploiting the poor can be very profitable so get to work!",UnethicalLifeProTips,Jshbone12,3,0,2020-05-31

Some of you will downvote/complain about animal cruelty) but sometimes, scaring them once or twice is better than having a sly kitty getting stuck inside and potentially dying.

3449, Take advantage of current restaurant pandemic streamlining for free meals,"(Only use this on corporate eateries please) 
So I've been trying to make ends meet and doing deliveries with apps like postmates. It has come to my attention that big corporate eateries have streamlined their pickup for delivery in response to the pandemic. I'm posting this for folks that really need a meal so here goes.

During peak hours it's all hands on deck for the restaurant. They typically have set up several tables with displays for all the delivery apps. They place the packaged food here for us drivers to pick up without any contact with their staff. They're busy doing orders so they won't pay you any attention not that they usually do.


All you need is to look like a delivery driver. That means buying a hot storage bag with an app logo, a facemask, and gloves. Enter the building and you will find signs for delivery drivers. Simply find any bag and read the name on it quickly in case they ask you for the name order. Pop it into your hot bag and walk out. Most of the time the staff doesn't even look at me walk in. Plus you have a mask on so CCTV can only do so much. 


Occasionally I get asked to show my app when picking up during slow times. If you are ever asked for your app simply tell the staff that your SO/friend has the app on their phone that's waiting outside in the car so you won't get a ticket. It's common for people to duo a delivery with a friend just to chat and prevent tickets. Simply fuck off and move on to the next joint.


If you decide to do this please hit up big corporate restaurants ONLY because all the small businesses are hemorrhaging and can't afford this tip.",UnethicalLifeProTips,carbonmammal,2,1,2020-05-25

If the police ask you why you called such-and-such 12 times between 10 pm and 3 am, stonewall. When they press, look conflicted, like you want to talk but it’s embarrassing. The key is to look uncomfortable but not guilty. Eventually, admit that you are an alcoholic and you’re trying to stay clean. Such-and-such isn’t exactly your sponsor, but they’re helping. On that night you were seriously craving a drink so you called them for help. If the police ask why you didn’t say that up front, get a little indignant and say “It’s Alcoholics ANONYMOUS, officer.” 

Once that card is played you have to start going to meetings and stay out of the pub, but it’s a good cover. You can even meet you co-conspirators at and after the meeting because you have established the relationship as being totally innocent. And, if you do run into the police after you’ve had a few, act contrite and ashamed. Ask them if they could give you a ride to a meeting.

3876,ULPT : Self Escalate Customer service,"Tired of being put on hold, talking to a robot, or generally being fucked around by a companies customer service hotline? Self Escalate!

Step one: Locate the number for corporate headquarters. This is usually different than the customer service number and has a local area code.

Step Two: Go on LinkedIn and see who may be a senior manager of customer relations, or in charge of the department causing you grief. He'll look up the CFO's name.

Step three: Call corporate, get switchboard operater and politely ask to be put thru to whoever you think can solve your problem.

***This may take a few attempts. LinkedIn isn't always accurate. Also, you can't ask the op for information. Do your homework. You need to give them the name or they will spam filter your ass quick.

This worked for me yesterday. Wait time was 4 hours. In about 30 min of research I had the executive vice president of customer relations on the phone for a big box store. Nice guy, we talked for a bit, complained about how hard B2B is, I told him that the wait music sucks, he agreed, and I got my issue resolved. Your mileage will vary depending on the situation. Most companies have a department dedicated to customer experience, if you are having a bad time, they truly want to know. It helps them fix the situation.

They didn’t even look at my machine. I walked in and they almost immediately said , do you want the same printer or something different. I laid out my printer on the table and they immediately came back with a brand new one. So basically you can do this every year or maybe 18 months and just say “it stopped working” and pay $20 to extend out the warranty for another 2 years and just keep the cycle going.

4103, Take Advantage of the Chaos and Test Run Domestic Partnerships,"As some of you may know, there is currently a world-altering event happening just outside our doors. Well, if you are in the unique position of having a partner you are considering living with and a roommate who has been forced to temporarily leave your home to relocate somewhere safer to ride out the storm, I cannot recommend highly enough using this time to test run living together. Your landlord probably wouldn’t be down for this (hence the unethical title), but they currently have bigger fish to fry. 
As I’ve surfed the web this month, tales of long-married couples who are discovering new irritating habits of their partners have been rampant. Why not get in on the fun and use it to kill two birds with one pandemic? This time of being forced to interact under high pressure and be together nearly 24/7 is proving itself a great way to glimpse the future and (hopefully) put some stuff to bed before a lease is attached to it. If your going to be stuck at home, you might as well get a jump start on the inevitable arguments about the dishes and trash. For the most daring among us, I recommend Expert Mode: only have a twin bed for both of you to sleep on. Hope you like tossing and turning!

Anyways, for those who don't know, a lag switch is basically a program that deliberately disconnects your internet and reconnects it. Like I said before, it's main use was for cheating in video games but we're gonna repurpose it. 

You can download one [here](https://wearedevs.net/d/Lagswitch). It's perfectly safe, you may get a false-positive but I can assure you it works well. 

When you encounter a difficult question, just press ctrl+e and your internet is disconnected! Pull out your phone or whatever and find the answer. When you found your answer press ctrl+q! It's really that simple! I would do it in random intervals so the teacher doesn't grow suspicions and play it off as cruddy internet, say that both of your parents are hogging up all the bandwidth or whatever. 

If you don't trust me, video call your friend and do the lag switch trick. On your friend's side, it would look like you froze.

4189, How to fuck your mom during the quarantine,"
Do you really want to fuck her or do you want to just talk about it. If you want to fuck her, and the quarantine, provides a golden opportunity for it, then here are the rules

**1\. Alcohol MUST be involved.**

It will lower her inhibitions, but that's not why we're using it here. What you need is for her to give herself permission to do something that's beyond her normal mode of behavior.

Get her drunk and comment how out of it she is and she'll never remember anything tomorrow. This will give her permission to be wild and not fear being judged for it.

Do not drink much yourself or you might have performance issues.Water down your drink, give her the full strength stuff. I say alcohol is a must but Xtasy is better as it REALLY drops inhibitions and makes them want to kiss n cuddle.

**2\. Stress the unprecedented quarantine and how it's driving everyone crazy.**

As above this will also give her permission to do something unprecedented in her own life-- like fucking her son.

Tell her how it's driving you crazy not to see a girl, etc.This will let her think of extra physical affection as keeping you sane: something a good mom would do.

However, do NOT be a whiny bitch. That will not make her want you inside her.

**3\. Pull close then back away.**

Let her enjoy your company then back off. Make her miss your presence. Give her a non-creepy kiss on the cheek and make her laugh with witty conversation. Then go cold.

If she asks what's wrong just tell her the social isolation is annoying you. Not in a whining way.

**4\. Zero foreplay.**

The normal rules of escalation do not apply to motherfucking. Once you manage to get her to French kiss you, pull her panties off and slip it in the hole you came out of.

Normal escalation from kissing to petting to fingering to fucking will detract from the whole ""it just happened. thing she needs to allow this taboo to happen.

Don't even take her bra off before you're inside her. Penetrate THEN undress her.

**5\. Assertiveness**

She is not going to take responsibility for this so you need to take the ""blame"".

The prone bone is ideal as you're the one doing the fucking-- in her mind. She's just lying there while you commit the incest.

If you do missionary, playfully pin her arms down and say things like ""gotcha"".

**6\. Write the script for her**

The whole virus thing makes for a great way to write the story for her so that it must happen to deal with the stress and keep everyone sane.

Other things are to ask her leading questions: ""Have you every felt so close?"", ""Do you like taking care of me?""

Judo her objections
""This is wrong""--&gt;""This is LOVE""
""We can't"" --&gt; ""We never would but we have to stay sane in quarantine""

Do not use the ""i"" word . . she will never incest with you, but she will surrender her body to keep you sane.

Good luck in your quest anon. I really hope that there is a whole lotta motherfucking going on world-wide during this pandemic.",UnethicalLifeProTips,breadfag,14,1,2020-03-29

First, gather a few friends and take two separate cars through the drive thru (ideally McDonalds or Taco Bell but I suppose any place would work). The first car orders ice cream or freezes or a malt, basically anything that would melt. The second car goes through and orders whatever they want. The first car then bolts the drive thru before paying for their order. The second car goes through normally, except when they get to the window the service worker will ask if you want the frozen treat (it would melt or be wasted otherwise). Lastly, humbly accept the frozen treats, pay for your order and leave to go meet up with your friends in the first car who are waiting in the parking lot across the street to enjoy your food together!",UnethicalLifeProTips,Eastview10,1,1,2020-03-15

4487,ULPT how to get free food from a fast food drive through,"This takes some timing and luck - but more likely than not you’ll have some success

- find desired drive thru you’d want to get free food from (McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Burger King, etc) 

- once at restaurant, make sure there is a car at the order window/screen AND a car at the pay window in the drive thru. Usually there is a gap between them. Timing is key, as you want to make sure you get in between these cars somehow. You’ll look like a dick, but this step is necessary

- when in front of the order car (OC) and behind the pay car (PC) - you’ll end up at the pay window yourself

- tell the employee you “just need sauce” or “wondering if I can get a cup of water”. Usually, they’ll have you go to the front, with the OC now at the pay window paying for their food. The original PC should be just about gone - with the OC food order being sent to the front

- you basically are mimicking the OC at this point. The food window has no idea you came into the line so they will probably assume you were next in line. With that said - and this part is a crap shoot - they will more than likely give you the food that was ordered by the OC, so you have to hope it’s something you want. 

- the OC will get pissed but most likely will have their food remade. Now get the hell out of there and enjoy your Big Mac :)

Anyways, Coles and Woolworths are giving priority to online orders, and have been for a while, and at this stage are honoring all online orders as sent, sometimes with minimal substitution. This is important because substitution really counts against a stores ratings to head office, cancellations hit them hard.

So you can order as much toilet paper on the app as you can afford, I think it maxxes out at 99 units, which is more than enough.

Anyways, the second part is when your 99 boxes rock up at 48 rolls a box, you pay $35 a box for them.

People have since been selling them on Facebook and Guntree for as much as $75/48 rolls which is basically doubling your investment.

How is this possible? I asked them, here is the response.

&gt;""We use Bitcoins to purchase items on dnm's (dark net markets), and we sell them on ebay for paypal. Our PayPal account are verified &amp; funds are legit. There will be no chargebacks.""

I assume they are buying cheap carded items.

***BE CAREFULL! I was part of their 'early bird' program and I have 8 transactions with them already with no problems or chargebacks. (1.2 BTC sold)*** 

***BUT is always risk that they are using stolen PP accounts/some other ""funky business"", so I advise you to use burner paypal address (no ID required, I had to submit my ID when I reached 2k USD; use photoshop to create fake ID; don't use US accounts).***


---

1) Go to [btc2pp.net](https://btc2pp.net?ref=8o7nppwz61f67gtx) [refferal link]

2) Create new transaction. You must sell more than 0.025 BTC to get 32% extra rate. If you sell anything less, you will get only 12% extra rate.

3)Deposit Bitcoins. Once transaction is confirmed, you will get 'enter bonus code' option on transaction page. Enter code EXTRARATE20 and you will get +20% on top of normal 12%.

4) Wait for funds to arrive. It can take 12-48 hours for bigger amounts.

5) Cashout (If you don't have bank account connected, buy gold with paypal (this site accepts paypal: https://mene.com) and sell it for cash).

6) PROFIT!!!

Say somebody wants to get revenge on a company, but can do it legally and through moral means, there's no reason to go destroying things for them unless that's deserved/what we want to do. Tell the submitter to go to another subreddit - I'm assuming comments providing tips following ethical ideology will be removed in accordance with rule one.

If we want to exact revenge on a person for a shitty act, and must do so through loopholes or just avoiding being caught? Tell the person about how to do that. On the other side, if there's a loophole to be taken advantage of? Tell people about it. A nifty way to get around queues, legal blockages or other societal stops? Spread the word.

If, however, you can just take revenge or advantage of something or someone in an illegal or amoral way, but to no real benefit of you or anyone else, just don't do it.

So really, it's $59.99 for 1.5 years, instead of just 1 year.","TL;DR = You can actually backup your stuff to Amazon Drive for 1.5 years, as long as you don't need to continually add more things to it.  

On Black Friday a few years ago, Amazon Drive's unlimited data storage was only like $5 for a year.  I got it, and started backing up ALL my personal files; family videos/photos/song recordings (I'm a musician), etc.  So if my house burned down, and I lost my computer and external hard drive backups, I still could access that stuff digitally.  

It was $59.99 a year for the unlimited storage, but then they changed it to only 1 TB of storage for $59.99.  1 TB was still plenty for my needs, so I just kept paying the $59.99 every year for the peace of mind.  Then one year, my credit card had expired, and I didn't update the new payment method.  I got an alert, and I logged in, and saw all the details relating to how it works.  I am not actively adding new things to this particular account, as I have about 950 gb worth of stuff on there already.  

So instead of immediately paying $59.99 to bring the account current, I waited 5 months, and then did it.

4694," If you're a convicted felon applying for work, don't disclose it. Many high end jobs don't check, but they still ask.","Honestly this could even be a LPT, but since it involves dishonesty I guess it goes here.

I interned at a company that bonded felons so they could get jobs (it's like insurance, if the felon steals the bonding company covers it).

Many high end jobs, even 6 figure salaried positions; don't background check. Almost all jobs however do ask if you're a felon.

**By checking the felon box, you're likely not even going to get an interview**. It's just the truth. Felons are the only class not protected federally by work equality laws. If you owned a business, would you take the felon or the equally qualified non felon?

However, by NOT checking that box - You can get the interview, you can get the job, and if it happens to come up later; you have a better chance of staying on board if they like you/are happy with your performance. Worst case, you get fired; which is no worse than not getting the job in the first place.

Government jobs, jobs involving children, healthcare -- all background check.

Most business/corporate jobs however, don't (they may SAY they do, and they may ASK, but they usually don't actually check). Office/Admin/Sales positions rarely check.

Lastly, the jobs that usually DO hire felons, are doing it for a huge tax break; and will likely pay minimum wage (fast food, custodial, etc). Good luck supporting yourself with that salary.",UnethicalLifeProTips,Butt-Pirate-Roberts,597,1,2020-02-23

4749," If you place a bet, place one that has a decent chance of winning.","Most preferable is to not bet at all. But, if you happen to bet please, for the love of God, give yourself a fighting chance of winning at least something.

A 25000/1 bet is great and all, but there is profit to be made on a 10/1 bet. 10 $£€ at 10/1 will see a return of 100 $£€.
A small return, but a welcome one.

Football Accumulators: only pick teams that stand a chance of winning.
Better still, choose a Double Chance option of either Home Win/Draw; Away Win/Draw; Home Win/AwayWin.

The odds are less per match (perhaps 10/3 [decimal:1.33]) but, accumulated with a few others matches, it will give you a chance to win a bit of money.

Instead of putting 1 $£€ on a 25000/1, try putting 10 or 20 $£€ on a 10/1 accumulator of Double Chance choices.

Cashing Out: as a rule of thumb, 50%+ of whatever you stand to gain is a decent return. 50 $£€ is still a decent return from 10 $£€.
Sometimes, it is better to cash out if things look like they could not go your way.

If you do this, you could add a tidy sum to your income.

Safe and smart betting, folks!

4790, How to get a job you’re not qualified for using a fake resume.,"**How to get a job you’re not qualified for.**

**Note\* In most places It's not illegal to use a fake resume. However if found out you can still be in some shit with your employer.**

**Step 1)** Pick the desired job. Something you could pass for if you get it. Something you can prove your “skill” in. Something you meet all the requirements for. Obviously, must pay well.

**Step 2)** Post a job listing for exactly what you’re looking for. Make a few posts across multiple sites, Copy and paste with slight edits an already existing listing with exactly what you want.

**Step 2.5)** If too many applications, call hiring agencies and ask what filters they use to sort through applications and use the same.

**Step 3)** Find the best resume(s). Copy and adjust it to your specific skills/background.

Make 2 resumes. 1 for you, and a second which is an ideal, overqualified resume with a fake name, use different contact information for this resume.

**Step 4)** Apply everywhere with the overqualified resume. The goal of this is to get phone interviews, and video interview requests. If video, pretend your camera breaks. If phone, change your voice. The goal of this is to gather a list of every question you’ll get asked, so when applying with your actual resume you can have answers ready and nail the first impression every time.

**Step 5)** Prepare for interviews. Do research on most likely asked questions. Make a list of every question and have answers ready. Decide a list of values for the impression you want to give off. Things like: Efficient, Has lots of options, conscientious. Design your answers around these values. This is where sales skills come in. Things like social proof, high value, fear of missing out. All of these and a few more is what you’re going for.

Also, create proof of experience that you don’t really have. Make a few fake screenshots and claim responsibility for work others did. If you encounter a question you don’t have proof for, ignore it and guide the conversation back to what you have ready.

**Step 6)** Apply everywhere. Don’t bother reading job listings, just apply. Copy n paste answers. Use ai bots to fill out applications for you. Do this as quickly as possible.

**Step 7)** The interviews. Try not to fuck up.. But you inevitably will. Each time you make a mistake or don’t know something, plan for the scenario to happen again and be ready. Oh, and don’t forget, you shouldn’t expect to get a job anywhere. If you assume you’re going to fail, then that takes a lot of pressure off. Just have fun with it. Experiment with thing nobody else would.

**Step 8)** Get hired. Make money. And just in case you thought this was the victory, this is actually when things start getting difficult. Try to outsource as much work as you can.",UnethicalLifeProTips,Starting2Decay,14,1,2020-02-16

4884, Keep an old pair of crutches and a leg brace around so when you order delivery you can pretend to be crippled...,"....and put in the delivery notes that you're crippled (or injured, on crutches, etc.), your apartment building doesn't have an elevator, and you can't climb the stairs.

This will force the delivery driver to find parking and bring the order to your door without expecting a huge tip or copping a bad attitude for being asked to make an extra effort. It's a win-win - they feel good because they did something nice for a disabled person, and you don't have to walk down the stairs and climb back up to get your food/weed/whatever you're ordering. 

This tip is obviously restricted to people in apartment buildings without elevators. I live in Los Angeles, and it is common here for the older apartment buildings to be two or three stories and not have an elevator. However, if you tried, you could definitely stretch this narrative a bit to account for apartment buildings with an elevator or even a home (although I find people who live in actual homes in the suburbs rarely have this problem with delivery drivers because they have an easy time parking). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And to elaborate on my ""justification"" for this tip:

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that any non-disabled person has the right to ask a delivery person to come right to their door; however, in LA, I've found that delivery drivers tend to cop an attitude when you ask them to park and walk to you, especially if it involves climbing stairs. I understand why it's a pain in the ass to park and walk - it takes a lot more time and with Postmates/UberEats/DoorDash/etc. the drivers have a huge incentive to do as many orders as possible as little time as possible (according to friends who have driven for some of the apps they do this because most people don't tip well/at all). 

And I get that that's the driver's problem; however, having known quite a few people who have done postmates/grubhub/ubereats/etc, if you piss them off or inconvenience them enough, I have heard firsthand stories from former/current drivers of them taking a few fries from difficult customers' food, etc.. I've never heard of anything serious like a driver putting something in the food; however, I wouldn't put it past someone to do. 

I'm a huge germaphobe, and I feel violated knowing someone may have had their hands in my food/contaminated it in some way. Idk if anyone else feels the same, but I feel like this is an innovative and harmless solution to get the delivery driver to make the extra effort while effectively eliminating the chance of them getting pissed and/or possibly messing with/picking at your food. 

And most people will go out of their way to be a little kinder/accommodating to handicapped people. And a lot of the delivery apps have a rating system that applies to customers and drivers. I'm obligated to say that I have never driven for a delivery service; however, again, I've heard firsthand accounts of drivers giving customers poor ratings for making difficult/unconventional requests. 

Especially with UberEats, PostMates, etc. and other delivery apps taking over the food delivery space, drivers can always claim the restaurant made a mistake or someone there messed with your food. It's different than when a delivery driver who is an employee of that restaurant messes with your food and gets accused after bringing it to you themselves. Restaurant employees are likely to see consequences, while the postmates/ubereats/etc. drivers are not. If pressed and the customer and/or company and/or restaurant are making a big deal about the order not being right or being tampered with, the driver can always claim they just forgot to check the order before leaving the restaurant. They may end up not making any money on that order; however, if pressed/accused, they wouldn't see any real consequences (unless it happens often). And again all this information comes directly from multiple friends who have driven for these apps in the past.

Not to justify this behavior as a customer; however, I see this as an equally and opposite unethical response to protect against the strong likelihood of  you, the customer being on the receiving end of unethical behavior that's often overlooked because people tend to empathize with a service industry worker more than a customer who is being lazy and demanding.",UnethicalLifeProTips,mrcartminez,5,1,2020-02-08

4901,Free Money?!?!?!,,UnethicalLifeProTips,HelloReddit42,2,1,2020-02-09
4902,ULPT - Real Life money glitch!,"Ok  so basically i found a glitch on a website that i recently became a  member of.  This glitch allows members to use $10 coupons that stack  (i.e. x2 coupons = $20.00) an unlimited amount of times. Only limit to  this is that transactions have to be done within 30 minutes of placing  the order.

Here is how it works,

I  signed up for a credit account and got approved for $1000.00. They  offer 1 point for every 1 dollar spent, after you get 200 points you get  a 10 dollar coupon. 2000 maximum points can be earned per transaction.

I  then spent $800.00 on 1 item in store and got (4) $10 off coupons. This  item is still able to be returned after redeeming the points.

A  few days passed and I saw a nice deal online and I signed into my  account, and used the coupons to get $50 worth of items for $10.00.

I  placed order and continued browsing, saw something I wanted, went to the check price in cart, and it said my coupons were still there. So I went  ahead and made another $50 order for just a $10 dollar bill. Checked  both orders and they were both confirmed as being placed.

So  at this point about 25 minutes have passed before I realized this, so I  placed 2 more orders and when trying to place the third it was not  showing up anymore. I realized this was due to the 30 minute  ""Cancellation Period"" was over, cementing my first order in place. So in 30 minutes, i placed 5 orders, spent 50 dollars and got 250 dollars worth of stuff.

I  waited a few days and called the company, they confirmed two things for  me. The first was that all the orders I had placed actually went  through. The second was that nothing showed up on their end that threw  up any red flags as far as a customer getting $250 worth of goods for  $50.

I tried it again with a 10.00  off voucher that came in the mail and it worked the same way.  So the  ideal setup would be to have the coupons for points as they don't need  to be manually typed in every time you make the purchase.

Ok now, you may have read that and said to yourself, wow, this is very vague.

The  reason it is vague is because if I said what it was, people with deeper  pockets would have the ability to get $5000.00 Items sent to their  house for free, (just pay shipping) lol. And that would only result in  this loophole getting blasted shut. Hint: Its a major retailer, has an online website, and can buy very expensive items!

My  main reason for posting is because this site does sell a lot of high  end items, so my goal would be to get $1500.00 or more in reward  credits, and use those to buy a $1500.00 Item, over and over again for  30 minutes, get 20-30 orders in and get that cool 20-30k worth of items  delivered to my doorstep with a receipt to prove the purchase!

Can  anyone help recommend the best way to get this money! I am broke so  earning points is rough. need to spend 15k on items to get the points,  these items are returnable, as points are applied and coupons earned  automatically. But points get limited to 2k points per transaction. So would need 8 separate transactions of \~1900.00, then you could literally pull a diamond heist.",UnethicalLifeProTips,HelloReddit42,0,1,2020-02-09

I started a support chat session with Amazon and they asked for me to send it back. I told them that considering the size of the monitor and the fact that I already attached it to my monitor mount, it wouldn’t be feasible. They offered me a partial refund of 20% of the purchase price which I gladly accepted. 

A friend of mine also had a very similar experience and got 30% back.

1. Get an app like TextNow which let's you make VOIP numbers.

2. Call and set an appointment on the day you desire with your real info(preferably on a day you will know will be busy) and ask about times and stuff.

3. Create multiple TextNow accounts and numbers using the Gmail . Trick. Here is a generator for it

https://thebot.net/api/gmail/

4. Book the hours around your appointment using the TextNow accounts you created in this pattern.

1pm - leave empty
2pm - book
3pm - your appointment
4pm - book
5pm - leave empty
6pm - book
7pm - leave empty

5. Once you show up there should be no wait time or holds. Plus you left some space for other people to book so they can't pinpoint it to you making fake appointments. Also you booked on a busy day so you know at 1pm and 5pm, and 7pm slot will be empty.

If your rating drops they gave you below 3 star and submit this complaint to get them banned.,"I take Uber a lot and am always nice, but sometimes I get some asshole who is either a trash driver or is rude and 1 stars me for no reason even after I tip. 

First when this happens you go your recent trips and change the rating from 5 to 1 star. Then go to support and say one of these things.

1 - Driver photo doesn’t match driver. You can even take a picture from the backseat and just make sure to only get his back side. Uber takes this super seriously and will ban the drivers indefinitely usually within a day. 

2 - Make complaint towards drivers car. Possibly talk about how the brakes squeak bad or how the driver refused to turn on the air conditioning / heater. 

3 - Almost no drivers follow speed limits exactly. Just take a video of a straight road and slightly speed it up and say you felt unsafe. 

4 - If you really wanna get them banned for life say you saw an open container of alcohol in the driver side compartment or that he smoked a cigarette before you got into the car. 


Any of these will get a driver banned.",UnethicalLifeProTips,radar746,17,1,2020-01-12
5295, If you are in or going into college get married in order to get a better financial aid package.,"This one works in the USA I'm not sure about the laws elsewhere. To apply for financial aid at American universities you fill out a fafsa. The fafsa uses you and your parents income  to calculate the amount your family can afford to contribute to your tuition. The calculation is bullshit it doesn't take into account siblings,  cost of living, or whether or not your parents actually intend to contribute. Regardless the FAFSA expects you to include your parents income. However you can avoid including your parents income if you are married, with the landmark supreme court case Oberfell vs. Hodges it is easier than ever to get married. Find a friend who also wants a better aid package, make an appointment at the courthouse, and sign some paperwork. I recommend a solid prenup just incase once of you turns out to be a major dick, you can find solid prenup templates online that you can sign and have notarized while you are at the courthouse. As long as you can avoid banging your new partner until you are out of college you are also eligible for an annulment, which will set your legal standing back to single (this has occasional legal relevance and is the ideal situation) 

For this to work you may need to fill out an additional form with your school which explains why you have a sudden change in family income so that you don't trigger a fraud or accounting issue in your schools financial aid office. Also fill out your FAFSA as soon as it is available as financial aid is often available on a first come first serve basis, especially Pell grants which are going to be your bread and butter with this trick. 

I can confirm that this method works in practice, the brothers in the prelaw fraternity at my school all got married to one another in 2015. They all got basically 50% or better covered off of their tuition. 

Make sure you have a reason prepared just in case your financial aid officer asks why you married so young or suddenly, arranged religious marriage is easy and convenient, thus shouldn't be a problem but it doesn't hurt to be prepared.",UnethicalLifeProTips,squirrelbee,0,1,2020-01-12

5410, Lucrative Studen Loans,"Some countries offer lucrative student loans with low interest (for example 0.01) to students. A lot of these countries are experiencing inflation wich is typically much higher than the interest. I think you know where this is going...

If you take a loan of say 20 000 dollars with an interest of a generous 0.1 interest and the inflation is of course much higher than 0.1, then you make money! Quite a lot actally, it all depends on how much they loan you. This being said, it is no gurantee that the interest will not raise corresponding to the inflation, and this obviously does not apply to the US.

Not much else will get someone banned from Twitter. 

If you’ve seen a someone recently doing something like that, you need to use the report button and specifically name it as targeted harassment. Hopefully the person being harassed, maybe another political figure or leader of another country, will also use the report button and specifically flag it as targeted harassment.

5465, Two Major Plagarising Techniques,"If you don't have the time and money to complete a thesis, don't fret, for there is two major techniques I want to share for you to apply in plagiarizing your thesis. For copy and paste is the most common type of plagiarism used by students that are caught doing so. I advice not using copy and paste at all means except for quotes and citations.

&amp;#x200B;

   1.Online paraphrasers

There is a lot of free services online that lets you paraphrase sentences to paragraphs of text.Though its not 100% accurate in grammar, atleast all you had to do is skim and check for any errors in your altered text. All you need is a source, and then use these services to alter the words to avoid getting caught because of copy and paste. Here is a few recommendations I can give;

a. Google Translate - You might be surprised, but all you need to do is paste your text, translate it to a different language, and then translate it back, and bam, its words will alter and be paraphrased for you.

&amp;#x200B;

b. Quillbot(dot)com - Common choice for altering text, but I've heard its algorithm is too predictable and bigger schools usually are aware of this online service.

&amp;#x200B;

c. Paraphrasing-tool(dot)com - Its like quillbot, but I find it better when it comes to phrases with a more abstract meaning. It may use deeper words but its better than any paraphrasers I've used. Its still not perfect, but its good enough if you want to save time in paraphrasing words instead of doing it one by one.

&amp;#x200B;

   2.Wikipedia

Not just to use it as a data hunter, but at every article page there is a section called ""References"", so instead of citing the Wikipedia page, use these citations instead and you won't have to deal with teachers that discriminates wikipedia so much.",UnethicalLifeProTips,Akira_Satoru,1,1,2019-12-28

5598, How to successfully catfish,"Alright so this is a guide on how to be a successful catfish

What you will need: 

An iPhone (5-X) running 13.2.2 or earlier. If you want to use something newer, it can only be running 12.4 or earlier. You may use android devices but I cannot help with specifics

A Instagram account. This is the most time lengthy part. Youll need to work on building a normal looking instagram account. 

A Tinder account. You can use other dating app service but keep in mind, Tinder is the most popular one and doesnt require you to verify yourself.

A Snapchat account (you'll need to purchase one with a decently high score). Low scores can be red flags. ONLY INSTALL SNAPCHAT VERSION 10.56.0. More instructions below.

A iMac or Macbook that can run CheckRa1n. (

A host (someone very active on social media) that does porn work (I.E onlyfans, premium snap etc). If youre doing this as a girl, try to choose someone that isnt overly hot/popular

A phone service. You can go with a free texting app but honestly those arent very ideal. Better to pick up a SIM card from target/walmart/where ever and get a cheap pay-as-you-go plan. Theyre normally like $15 or $20 a month for unlimited texts which is all you need. REMEMBER to stay consistent. If the host youre using clearly is using an iPhone then youll need iMessage which cant be activated unless you have actual service. If your host uses android, thats fine you can disable iMessage. 

Turn off FaceTime to prevent any mishaps since its super easy to accidentally to hit answer if youre just playing with the phone. Facetime also connects super fast (you normally wont come across people that randomly try to FaceTime but better safe than sorry).

First off, you will need a phone that you will specifically use for catfishing. Its better to use a separate phone from your main phone because of what we'll have to do to it. I prefer using iPhones since iPhones generally have better jailbreak support than android devices. Not to mention, you have the extra option to use iMessage.

Jailbreaking:

Unfortunately, as of right now, you need a Mac to jailbreak iPhones 5-X. I mentioned earlier you could use newer iPhones, but Apple changed something in their code to where the software for jailbreaking those devices doesnt work. Use CheckRa1n to jailbreak. CheckRa1n is super easy to use so I wont be covering it. Just google it

List of jailbreaks youll need:

AppStore ++ (for installing an older version of Snapchat) 

Wraith (Snapchat tweak) As I mentioned above, youll need Snapchat version 10.56.0 and lower. Do not go any higher, Snapchat will ban you.

Relocate tweak. This is for spoofing your location as it is important to be in a completely different location as your host to avoid getting caught.

I think I covered everything. Now its up to you to get creative. Work on making your catfish completely believable. Remember to stay consistent with your story. Make whoever you're catfishing be comfortable with you. Send them normal selfies without them asking first. Try not to ask for nudes/talk sexual right off the bat. Have a normal conversation. Try posting normal everyday events to your story/IG account

Good luck! Thanks for reading",UnethicalLifeProTips,throwaway2091234,0,1,2019-12-22

5605, Need some extra cash in a pinch? Lie to your bank and they’ll give it to you.,"Here’s one I found by happy accident. Go to a bank and make a cash deposit at the ATM. After the deposit is complete call the banks hotline and complain that the ATM ate some of the money you deposited. You’re more likely to pull this off if it’s just one bill so say it was either a $20, $50, or $100 bill.  

The bank will apologize and immediately credit your account with said amount, with the disclosure that they will investigate the situation. If they find it to be untrue they’re within their rights to withdraw the money in 30 days. Thing is this is a common occurrence and $100 is chump change to just about any bank/credit union so 9 times out of 10 they’ll just grant you the money without issue. 

I should add that the best time to do this would be on a Sunday when the bank is closed. Most still have a hotline you can call on Sundays, if they don’t then even better, call back Monday. This limits the chances of them immediately sending someone out to check the ATM and prove your statement wrong.",UnethicalLifeProTips,dullbrain,1,1,2019-12-22

5625," if you want to find out whether your new boyfriend would be good with kids, don’t test on animals - try drunk people","Consider:

1. While on a date, you don’t just unexpectedly encounter unfamiliar animals in need of assistance - this isn’t a romance novel. Folks drunk off their arses are abundant if you know which places to go. Just make sure it’s a benign place and not the kind where people get stabbed. Unless you’re into that.

2. More close to life - small children and drunk people can be reasoned with roughly on the same levels, which is not much but significantly different from how one would reason with animals. Many absolute psychopaths and serial killers have been fond of animals, and gentle with them.

3. That is a human person - a surprising amount of people (I was going to say ”women” but who knows) figure that their partner’s ”parenting instincts” just instantly kick in when it’s *his* baby. That doesn’t really happen as strongly or often as you’d think, sometimes it’s just ”ok I don’t know you and I don’t like you and you just threw up on me, but if nobody else is gonna make sure you’re ok, I guess I gotta.”

So what I did was , I Asked my grandmother to spit in a little tube a few times for an “ancestry test”

Then I cut a square corner from a sandwich bag, filled it with the aforementioned spit and sealed it shut with a lighter, creating sort of a sauce sachet filled with saliva.

I then stuffed the little sachet to the back of my mouth behind my back teeth. It was small enough to not create a bulge in my cheek and also discreet enough to still be able to talk. So I entered the office, anxiety.jpg. Played it totally cool and then pierced the bag with my teeth and soaked it in the second hand spit. 

And it worked. I passed a drug test using my grandmothers spit. I feel like I’ve dishonoured my family but man it fucking worked.

Order a bottle of spirits / champagne etc, heck even a couple of bottles then contact customer services after it's been ordered and tell them the bottle has leaked / is smashed.

Don't need to explain further. 

If they ask for evidence you just tell them you've already chucked it away as it was leaking / was dangerous with the glass shards.

Same rule applies of course to aftershave. 

They will offer you the choice of a refund or replacement. Up to you what you fancy.

Source: I work for the company and have done their customer service training.

Also, most items below around $10 it's cheaper for them to send a replacement without getting you to also send back the 'defect' item, so do go ahead and do that as well.

This will work on all accounts, but don't over-do it. Go for a couple of bottles in the first hit, then after some regular orders, go for a 2-for-1 cheapie product on the second method.

Beware that their software can quickly pull up all accounts with your zip or postal code, so if you're doing it multiple times use different addresses (work, partner, sibling etc) and different payments types.

6105, Get free Christmas gifts from Reddit. No kids required. But kids mean more. Also tips to get more gifts.,"**Step One: Register to get free stuff**

Go to r/SantasLittleHelpers and go through their registration process. No karma requirement, no proof of need, just register. Make an amazon wishlist for yourself and make up some kids. If you have less than 4 people, you don't need a photo to prove how many people there are. If you're feeling like you want a big fake family, just find a photo on someone's facebook or insta and use it.

There is no requirement that you are low income or anything. You just have to believe in the Santas of Reddit. Limit is $100 per kid and $25 per adult. So you can get whatever you really want if you make up a big enough family. 

**Step Two: Make Amazon List**

Pick items you kind of want, or would be appropriate for your fake kids. You can always return them for gift cards to Amazon later. 

Be sure to leave the ""dream gifts"" on there, too. Sometimes a Santa will just buy out the whole list. If anyone questions an item on your list, be sure to say your autistic child you're homeschooling always plays on Amazon and it was a mistake.

Do not turn off the ""bought elsewhere option."" There are reminders and mod notes in the sub to do this. Don't. This is important for Step Four.

Be sure to make all purchases hidden, too. That way when Santas click on your wishlist, they can't see what has been bought. It will look like your kids have nothing. So, they will buy more.

**Step Three: Make Post**

You're going to need to appeal to the Reddit community. The ones that get the most attention are ""my kid is autistic and must have this exact game/game system/toy."" Throw in some sob stories about domestic violence, daddy in jail, or made up mental illnesses. Those go a long way for getting stuff. So does saying you're a student, single parent, stay at home mom, or that you homeschool your kids. Car accidents, fires, floods...these all go a long way, too.

Be sure to say ""be blessed"" or that you will pay it forward. You don't have to. That's just what people do. Oh, and be sure that one of your kids says that you need to post your wishlist because you are the bestest mommy. 

**Step Four: If no one buys stuff for you, wait a few days and claim to get Grinched.**

""Grinching"" means that your wishlist is marked complete on Amazon but nothing has been bought. You may have to have a friend go in and mark your list ""bought elsewhere"" as proof to the mods. This will allow you to post again, saying your kids are devastated because they thought there would be a Christmas and now there isn't any.

So, TL;DR: r/SantasLittleHelpers gives away free gifts. If you're an unethical dude, you can get more stuff. You can also return gifts for Amazon gift cards and DNA a bunch of these gifts.

This works for anyone you regularly are in contact or live with, so friends family and coworkers usually.

Get caught lying about little things, like eating the last [food item] or something. When you get caught, lie like a deer in a street lamp, be unconvincing and unconfident. After doing this a few times, you are seen as a bad liar. 
Another thing you can do is to laugh when it’s brought up, as in a laugh that you know something but don’t want to say it. Just act suspicious when asked basically so you get caught in the lie.

Now when you actually need to lie, just go for it, straight face, confident voice, no stammering and a convincing but not overly though our seeming story.

People thing you are bad at hiding stuff, so the stuff you do hide is hidden better.

Personally this works wonders on my family, and also teachers, and I occasionally get caught in small things still just to keep up the facade.",UnethicalLifeProTips,StormOJH,30,1,2019-11-09

6177, Use your coworkers to get a threat out without making the threat directly,"This is a piggy back off [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/dtuy3c/lpt_never_tell_a_coworker_anything_you_wouldnt/) Life Pro Tip. I figured instead of complaining that people gossip and that you can't be real with your coworkers - use it to your advantage. 

Best to use this tactic to buy time/breathing room to find a new job:

**Situation**: Your manager is making your life hell. Maybe you have enough for a legal harassment charge or hostile workplace or discrimination or all of the above. Maybe you don't. 

**Task**: Get your manager to back off without making a direct threat which usually just exacerbates things and gets HR directly involved. 

**Action**: Take the coworker on your level that is the most likely to snitch on you or the closest to your manager to lunch (don't pay for lunch or else it may be suspicious). Vent about all the poor things your manager is doing. Ask for advice. Thank them for that advice. Then mention how you already have a solution. Wait for them to ask. Then tell them you already lawyered up and just need to collect a few more incidences to build a case. 

**Resolution**: Your manager's back will never be straighter around you because she knows you already have a lot of ammo (or you don't and you psyched her into believing you have ammo). 

**Reflection:** This could backfire with a truly aggressive/stupid manager. Fantastic. So let's hope to you having real ammo, actual lawyers and the easy opportunity to collect more from a willing manager. Doubtful. 

Alternative Manager Response #1 - Get HR Involved based on Hearsay

Deny it. If they go so far as to bring the person you had lunch with, you can make sure that person goes down as an office gossip/snitch. BUT use the opportunity to tell HR (KEY - send them an email in writing after the meeting as a recap) that you think X manager is discriminating against you for a trait you have no control over (vague wording points to sex, religion, race, etc - basically Federally protected classes). You have had conversations about this with your manager, but the hostile behavior does not seem to change. 

Use the manager's paranoia to go to HR in the first place against s/he  

Result? You buy even more time to look for a new job, they give you a new manager, or turn the tables on your manager internally under the guise that s/he went to HR first and not you (important. Some folks still think you're a snitch if you go to them first) by getting them fired or relocated. 

Depending on how you play it - nothing happens to your manager and you look like a litigious hot button or you win the war with your manager. Keeping emails and conversation logs are key. 

Alternative Manager Response #2: Fully Flaccid 

Or it could cause them to not attack you anymore (desired result) but give you shit projects/ignore you by engaging as little as possible. This gives you space. But you may have to look elsewhere for work within the company (unless your manager trashed your rep behind your back) or outside of it. 

Best to use this tactic to buy time/breathing room to find a new job. The company will probably give you your last two weeks on PTO (assuming you are going to work for a competitor) just to make sure that you don't come back with a lawsuit if they dishonorably walk you out w/o working the last two weeks.",UnethicalLifeProTips,PopularTradition,3,1,2019-11-09

2) Never say or anything too incredible. People often become suspicious If you claim to be a war hero. Also stay away from professions that deal with specific technology like mechanics. 

3) Pretend to be something low-key that every base needs like a cook or an analyst. Then learn the MOS or job code for it

4) Get to know some basic Regulations and facts about the military. 

-AR 670-1: Dress and appearance for the Army

-AFI 36-2903: Dress and appearance for the Air Force

-The UCMJ: uniform code of military Justice AKA military law.

5) NEVER purchase or wear a uniform. This makes it all too easy to snuff out fakes. Any veteran will just show their DD-214

6) NEVER claim to be high-ranked. Always claim to have gotten out as an E-4. This is the most common pay grade to get out at

E-4's go by different names per branch here's a list: 
specialist in the Army, 
corporal in the Marine Corps, 
senior airman in the Air Force, 
petty officer third class in the Navy.

7) When in doubt play it cool, Don't get fed up. If someone questions you look at them as if they're dumb. Don't act outraged.

One of the tricks and tools available to you is to purchase all the browsing and purchase history associated with an employee's Google account. Using this information, you can then begin to harass them at work with offhanded comments on things they purchased or subscribed to. This employee isn't doing what you want them to do so you'll harass them until they do. They'll either quit, which is great for you, or they'll submit. Since you work at Allstate, you have no morals or ethics (they frown on ethics and morals). What makes this great is that you can purchase the personal data of any of your colleagues as well! Did a female employee just purchase a pregnancy test? Time to get rid of her. You don't want to pay someone maternity leave when they're not producing any work output. Did a male employee just buy an engagement ring? Get rid of him. They'll be wanting more money and less work. We're running a business. These are tried and true techniques of Allstate management. They con you into believing you're great all the while working behind the scenes to pay you as little as possible instead of paying you fair market wages. ""But money doesn't matter!"" they'll tout. If that were truly the case they would be a not for profit institution. So if you have no morals or ethics, enjoy manipulating people for the detriment of their careers, join Allstate management.

6286, *EXTRA* Free Annual Credit Report Without Any Security Checks.,"Preface (ULPT at the bottom): 

This ULPT came about from making a complaint.

I had issues with account creation at the credit reporting agencies due to them not following the RFC standard/guidance for allowable email address characters (and other issues).

You may already know you can get a free credit report either in digital or hard form via each of the 3 credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, Transunion) each year. Just cycle around the 3 agencies over 3 years.

For me, it began with one of the agencies not accepting my \*correct\* answers to the security questions, so I couldn't get the digital copy. Calling made no difference.

Fine, I just went with a different agency and got it. Then I made a complaint at annualcreditreport (.com) and surprisingly got an unwanted hard copy sent to me in the mail from the original agency. According to them, I failed the security checks (wrong). But later on, I'll find out it came to me because of the complaint where \*NO\* security checks were done.

Then later this year I had to unfreeze my credit report for something. Again, I encounter issues with their site(s) and I make another complaint when customer support was useless.

Again, this instance was about UNFREEZING my report. I had NO interest in another credit report being sent to me.

annualcreditreport (.com) -&gt; ""Contact Us"" -&gt; ""Continue to contact form"" -&gt; ""Other"" -&gt; (check off whatever agencies) -&gt; other -&gt; Description.

This is what I did. You may only need to select one of the other options where you don't have to put in any information (description).

I think my complaint for that second time was about the web site and the useless support, or no way to contact a human.

Again, I'll emphasize that I did NOT want my credit report sent to me, just for them to fix their problems... but both agencies I selected sent me my credit report. Again, no security checks were done, and this is now 2 credit reports from 1 agency received in 1 year.

I'm flummoxed why I was getting these credit reports sent to me and calling support was again like pulling teeth trying to get an explanation. At least that one agency had a different contact phone number on the report that did let me speak to a human.

I finally made one last complaint that was also a test. I selected those agencies again, and explicitly stated that I did NOT want to receive any ""complementary"" credit report sent to me.

You can probably guess that I DID receive another credit report, but only from one of the agencies (so far). That makes it 3 hard copies from that 1 agency in 1 year.

I have no interest in hard copies. I only want the digital form. Being one who cares about the environment, it pains me. Then add on the fact that there is no security involved in getting the credit report shows that nothing was learned from 2017.

This is our society folks, enjoying the ride so far? It's only going to get worse.

&amp;#x200B;

ULPT:

Make a complaint at annualcreditreport (.com) via ""Contact Us"" -&gt; ""Continue to contact form"", and you may very well see a hard copy of your credit report come to you in the mail.",UnethicalLifeProTips,0vindicator1,0,1,2019-11-03

6304," When your trying to get away with lying, you probably don't need to lie.","I saw a post about lying and it seems there's a decent gap of knowledge in deception. 
If your being confronted with a question that honesty is not in your best interest lying should be one of the last things you should consider.

Avoid the question. Can you steer the conversation away from the topic at hand? If the conversation does not begin with an accusation you can refer back to an older portion of the conversation and say meaningless points stalling allowing public interest to die or simply running out of time ""I have to to to work now I'm late!"" ""I am far too busy for this I still have homework to do..."". 

If conversation is initiated with a question you can't exactly talk about your German Shepard puppy from a conversation two days ago, so you deflect blame. ""Do you think I am the one who did this?!?"" "" Why was your wallet stolen?"" You get the idea distract then always have a vague and plausible scapegoat. The dog ate your food off the counter or must have been some neighborhood kids who stole your pack of cigarettes outside. This works better if your know as an honest person.
This is when you will escalate to lying. Lying is a consumable resource and once it's gone there's almost never getting any back. The more you lie the less truthful you appear no matter how good you are. That last state in particular is a opinion formed from personal experience with lying most of my life as is the advice I'm passing along. Keep the lie simple! They don't need to know your wife was six months pregnant, or the fact you always walk this street at 3:30 pm to head home from work. Innocent people do not explain why they are minding their own business but guilt ridden people feel the need to explain a mustard stain from seven years ago. Such an obvious sign. 

Speaking of few details keep it short but not rushed. If you sort out your lie it will sound like you said it two hundred times in the mirror that morning. Say too much or go to slow increase the risk of showing body language to reduce your chances of appearing innocent. K.i.s.s. 

If you know someone is coming to confront you about a subject you know your dead to rights but they are naive to deception do not attempt to lie. This is almost always a trap as they have evidence showing contrary to what ever statement you will make. Keep a calm or maybe even a slightly annoyed face. Avoid over exaggerating  innocence like a shocked face to a minor event or a quick denial of the situation. Size up the question in your head give it thought a glance to the right is a decent bait. Common misconception is that looking to the right while thinking is forming a lie left honest response. This has been debunked and a quick Google search can prove that. however, do not give them the opportunity to look it up.
 Make an argument of ethos (appeal to authority) as if you are an expert on the subject and correct them on how the information was incorrect or flat out lie. Avoid using illogical conclusion fallacy (example : if I was answering phones in the back of the store! How could I have stolen money from the cash."") It doesn't logially make since and goes against logos (appeal to logic). 
You've been engaged and you've either baited them into an irrelevant question like eyes darting around or you immediately counter with a VALID question that requires a response. If baited question works use that to dismiss the accusation like ""you cannot even  get widely known common knowledge right! How can  we, believe what your saying now?"" Always include any bystanders paying attention no one likes to be alone or have a chance of being wrong. Know your enemy and their insecurities. You can challenge those as character flaws or questionable integrity. 

Now here is when both methods mesh back together. Bury your opponent in again valid questions that would reasonably require a response. Most will struggle to keep up with the pace you should get 5 or 6 our in 30 seconds. This would leave the average Joe in a stupur trying to find answers to all the questions or simply remember them. 

Kick them while they are down. You've just had a challenge to your character assassinate theirs. Knowing the darkest flaws can be pulled out for public display especially if they brought an entnourage on a righteous quest to bring you down ( you know the type). Even generic statements work so often. "" So do you always accuse people without solid evidence?"" "" Is it fun for you to start a witch Hunt here when we have bigger problems to deal with ...current issue
.."" ""what kind of scumbag does this?"" You get it. Make them a bad person it sends a clear two messages. One, this person is illogical and has made an accusation based on what they thought they saw or heard. Two do not challenge me without very solid evidence.

If the person questioning you is an expert liar. This may not mean they lie constantly but they are well informed about deception or simply you are caught red handed.
MINIMIZE! The whole Trump grab em by the *****... He was caught dead to rights. I'm an expert liar jumps to minimizing the accusation itself or personal blame. Well yeah I did that but so did ""Bob, Joe, and Kim! Common what's the big deal wevall do it?"" A part a minimizing is a precieved confession. If you know you left your wallet in a classroom you pulled a prank in and it's too late to cover your tracks confess before an acussation is made and minimize the act and individual blame.

Honorable mention: Bribery. Sometimes the simple act of offering to buy your way out of trouble. Never law enforcement that's just stupid. Never offer what you actually have for two reasons. One it's your money you don't want someone taking you for one hundred dollars when twenty was enough. Also offering a specific amount is ammo for a morally straight person who cannot be bribed. Let's say you have a ten and a one fold the ten over the one and offer twenty dollars. If you are accused of bribing them they will say you pulled out twenty dollars in the form of two tens when infact you do not have this.

6478," Download, Keep and Share Audible content via both the Audible app or MP3 Conversion!","So, while fucking around trying to make sure I wouldn't lose all of the audio books me and my now ex partner had (we shared our audible account), i figured the download to device option meant that the files had to be stored on my phone somewhere.... so i found them and planned to convert them to mp3 to keep forever. 

Turns out people must have been doing this previously and Audible worked it out. Anyone with the latest version of the app have different downloaded file types(AAXC) compared to the older versions of the app which download the files in AAX format. 

I uninstalled the Audible app on my old phone (galaxy note 8), reinstalled using the apk for the May 2019 version of the app and badabing badaboom, the files started downloading in AAX and not in AAXC. This meant I could transfer these files to my MacBook, and then download and use openaudible to convert the files to MP3 (openaudible does not have conversion capabilities for AAXC yet)... So I now have permanent copies of these files stored separate to the Audible app. But wait, it gets better...

Additionally, I created my own new audible account on my current phone (galaxy note 10+) which has the current version of audible installed. I transferred all of the AAX files into the audible file storage location for my new account. I could access all of the audio books using files downloaded from somebody else's (My ex's) audible account. 

It does realise you dont own the rights to the books occasionally and removes them from your library (yet doesnt delete the files), so to restore them back into your audible book device list, you simply go to your library, click the three dots in the top right corner and hit refresh. It resyncs any AAX/AAXC files sitting in your audible file folder on your device. 

So if you have friends and family who all use audible, you can send the downloaded AAX/AAXC files between yourselves via wifi transfer or Bluetooth, move them to the correct file storage location and all of a sudden you have access to listen to books that your friend or family member has purchased and visa versa.

6492," If given the option to rent either the upstairs or basement apartment of a house, choose the upstairs apartment even if it is more expensive. In the winter months, you can exploit thermodynamics and modern technology to leech heat from downstairs and save big on heating.","  This pro tip relies upon four facts of thermodynamics and modern house design:

1. Thermodynamics tells us that heat spontaneously flows from hot places towards the cold.

2. Heat rises because heating air causes it to expand and rise above the more dense cold air. 

3. Home thermostats are designed to turn on the heat when the room temperature falls below a certain point. When the temperature is above that point, the furnace cuts out. 

4. Insulation between floors tends to be lesser between floors rather than in the walls.

If you are a morally dubious home renter occupying the upstairs apartment, you can use these facts to stay warm on your neighbours’ dime. To stay warm in the winter, the downstairs tenants will set their thermostat to a high temperature. If you intentionally set your thermostat to a much lower temperature, you are creating a natural less insulated path for the warm air downstairs to rise towards. 

As the heat leaves their apartment and goes into yours, their thermostat will signal to their furnace to keep cranking out heat. Meanwhile, your furnace will rarely activate because of the trickling in heat and lower set point. You will not be as warm as the people downstairs per se, but you won’t be footing the as much of a bill.

And if the downstairs neighbours are new tenants, there is zero probability of them realizing something is amiss because they will have no previous winters to compare against.",UnethicalLifeProTips,SweatervestDude,10,1,2019-10-20

6550, How to become as successful as Thomas J. Wilson of Allstate Insurance Company.,"The simple answer as to why Allstate has been able to survive all these years doesn't come down to talent, strategy or influence. The simple answer is that they cheat. They lie and cheat use their army of lawyers to protect themselves. So in this essay we'll review all the methods they use to perpetrate their con. We'll cover bribing, breaking Federal Laws, and breaking guidelines set by the Department of Insurance.

We'll start with the easy one which is bribing. You can always tell which leader someone belongs to by the vehicle they drive. Each senior leader at Allstate has enamored him or herself with either the owner of a car dealership or one of their sales people. You see, a vehicle is the worst financial investment someone can make. It depreciates immediately after leaving the lot and often times the resale value only comes into play if you purchase a new vehicle every 4-5 years. So bribing employees with vehicles achieves two goals. The first is it puts the employee into debt. This ensures they have to maintain a job if they hope to make the payments. The second goal is to allow them to frame you for taking a bribe should you decide to do something other than what they cram down your throat. So it all comes down to keeping you enslaved to them and unable to leave or go anywhere else. How do they keep you from going anywhere else? Well, that brings to my second point which is breaking Federal Laws.

Allstate, over the course of years, has not only created economic slaves for itself, but has strategically placed key individuals at other corporations. When you want to break Federal Laws, it helps to be able to cover your tracks and if you're able to infiltrate some of the largest most influential tech companies, it helps all the more. They have used their influence to extract private personal data from US Citizens without their knowledge or their consent. But this sounds like an illegal wiretap? Yep. Illegal wiretaps, digital or physical, are a Federal crime. Allstate has offices in both Northern Ireland and India. Both do not fall within Federal jurisdiction of the United States of America. This is where they deploy, monitor and extract personal information from citizens of the United States. To be very clear, they actively pursue personal data from citizens of the United States. Why do they do this? Well, not only does it allow them to enact social justice as they see fit outside of any court of law. It allows them to actively and aggressively measure risk of individuals. This brings me to my third point, which is breaking guidelines set by the Department of Insurance.

The Department of Insurance is a regulatory body that regulates various facets of the insurance industry and professionals. The key areas being health, auto, homeowners and life insurance products. The DOI sets guidelines regarding the profiling of risk to protect the consumer from unfair pricing. How does it do that? It only allows insurance companies to set risk as small as geographic area codes. Any smaller and they could individually assign risk to a single household or even an individual. Insurance works because we spread the risk among a group of individuals. By bypassing this guideline, Allstate seeks to individually calculate risk of households and ""beat the system"" so to speak so they can pad their profits. Under all the fluff of all the various business units within Allstate is a group of individuals that mines the ill gotten data and uses it to create risk assessments of various households within the United States. The other departments are simply there to manufacture the ""evidence"" that they were operating within the guidelines set by the Department of Insurance. These are bright individuals with absolutely no morals or ethics. Often times they use contractors to keep Allstate hands clean. How have they not gotten caught? As I mentioned before, when you have influence into some of the largest technology companies in the world, you can cover your digital tracks quite well as they have done.

So in conclusion, to become as successful as Thomas J Wilson, CEO of Allstate, you have bribe, break Federal laws, and ignore all guidelines set by the Department of Insurance while creating enough business units to appear like you came to your calculations actually using data that is freely available to everyone. This requires you to throw away your morals, have absolutely no respect for the law, and decide that anyone and everyone can be forced to do what you want them to do.
